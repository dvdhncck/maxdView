<H3>Overview</H3>

This panel lets you selectively hide some of the rows of data by
filtering them out. 

The filter is constructed from a series of rules, such as:

<PRE>
  Probe Name contains "RNA" 
  PROB_2 &gt; 0.01
  TIME_2 &lt; 3.5
</PRE>
 
<P>There are two global rules, and one optional rule for each
Measurement. All of the rules are combined using a <I>logical AND</I>
operation, this means only genes which obey all of the rules will be
displayed.</P>

<P>At the bottom of the window the percentage of Spots which are
trapped by the filter is shown in red and the percentage of Spots
which are not trapped is shown in green. Note that the percentages
only reflect the filtering that is done by this filter, and do not
take into account any filtering being done by other filter plugins
that are also active.</P>

<P>As with all filter plugins, closing the plugin's window deactives
the filter (but iconifying it does not).</P>

<P><B>Name filtering....</B></P>

<IMG SRC="FilterByNameOrValue_Name.jpg">

<P>The first rule  applies the to the names, and can be specify that
the name must include some sequence of characters, or must not include
some sequence. Select which of the names to use (either Probe, Gene(s)
or Spot) and select which matching criterion to use.</P>

<P>As you type characters into the edit field, the filter is
continuously updated and spots are removed or displayed based whether
whether their name matches the rule.</P>

<P><B>Value filtering....(global)</B></P>

<IMG SRC="FilterByNameOrValue_Value.jpg">

<P>The second rule applies to the all of numerical values associated
with each spot. These values are grouped based on the type assigned to
them in the <A HREF="../../../docs/Measurements.html">Measurements</A> panel. You
can select between requiring "No value" "Any value" (i.e. 1
or more) or "All values" to conform to the rule.</P>

<P>The <I>operand</I> selection allows to you to choose how to compare
the numercial values with some constant value that you supply. The
options are:

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><B>=</B> <TD>equal to
<TR><TD><B>!=</B> <TD>not equal to
<TR><TD> <B>&gt;=</B> <TD>greater than or equal to
<TR><TD> <B>&lt;=</B> <TD>less than or equal to
<TR><TD> <B>&gt;</B> <TD>greater than
<TR><TD> <B>&lt;</B> <TD>less than
<TR><TD> <B>&lt;&gt;</B> <TD>in this range (+/-)
<TR><TD> <B>!&lt;&gt;</B><TD>not in this range (+/-)
</TABLE>

<P>The edit field to the right of the <I>operand</I> selection is where
you enter the constant value to compare the numercial values to.</P>

<I><B>Example</B></I>:<BR>

<P>To exclude any spot with a missing Expression value in any of it's
Measurements, set the rule to</P>

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Expression" "No values" "=" "NaN"</TT></P>

<P>(NaN is the special value used to represent a missing number)</P>

<P>To exclude any spot with a very high value, set the rule to</P>

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Expression" "Any value" ">" "100000"</TT></P>

<P><B>Value filtering....(per Measurement rules)</B></P>

<IMG SRC="FilterByNameOrValue_Measurement.jpg">

<P>The bottom part of the Filter panel contains controls for filter
rules to apply to each of the individual Measurements. Each rule can
be enabled or disabled separately using the checkbox next to it's
name.</P>

<P>The <I>operand</I> selection and edit field for the constant value
  are the same as for the global value filter. The rule is applied
  only to this the Measurement, and only if the rule has been
  enabled.</P>

<A NAME="nans"><H3>Handling of NaN and Infinity values</H3></A>

<P><B>Note:</B> This behaviour is different to that of versions prior to 1.0.4</P>

<P>The special value '<TT>NaN</TT>' (<I>not-a-number</I>) is used to represent
a value which is unknown or missing.</P>

<P>All comparisions in which a <TT>NaN</TT> value is tested against any non-<TT>NaN</TT> value
will be false, for example "<TT>NaN &gt; 3</TT>",  "<TT>NaN &gt;=
-2000</TT>", "<TT>400 &lt; NaN</TT>"
and "<TT>NaN &gt; NaN</TT>" are all false.</P> 

<P><TT>NaN</TT> values are equal to other <TT>NaN</TT> values, for example "<TT>NaN
&gt;= NaN</TT>", "<TT>NaN &lt;= NaN</TT>" and "<TT>NaN = NaN</TT>" are
all true.</P>

<P><TT>NaN</TT> values are not equal to any other value, for example "<TT>NaN
= 1.0</TT>" is false.</P>

<P>The special values '<TT>Infinity</TT>' and '<TT>-Infinity</TT>' represent positive and
negative infinity respectively.</P>

<P>Infinity values behave like extreme versions of normal values, so
<TT>Infinity</TT> is greater than any other number, and
<TT>-Infinity</TT> is less than any other number.</P>

<P>Magnitude comparisons of <TT>NaN</TT> values with <TT>Infinity</TT>
values are always false, for example "<TT>Infinity &lt; NaN</TT>" and
"<TT>NaN &gt;= -Infinity</TT>" are both false. However, equality tests
between <TT>NaN</TT> values with <TT>Infinity</TT> values behave as
normal, so "<TT>Infinity = NaN</TT>" is false and "<TT>-Infinity !=
NaN</TT>" is true.</P>

<P>A complete description of how comparisons with <TT>NaN</TT>,
<TT>-Infinity</TT> and <TT>-Infinity</TT> values work can be found <A
HREF="../../../docs/DoubleCompare.html">here</A>.</P>
