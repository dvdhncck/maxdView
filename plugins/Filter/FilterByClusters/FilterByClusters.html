<P><I>Filter by Clusters</I> chooses spots based on how many clusters they are
contained in.</P>

<P>A Cluster is only considered if it is currently visible. Visible
means that the clusters "Show" box is ticked in the <A
HREF="../../Viewer/ClusterManager/ClusterManager.html">Cluster
Manager</A>, not that the cluster can be currently seen in the
display.</P>


<P>At the bottom of the window the percentage of Spots which are
trapped by the filter is shown in red and the percentage of Spots
which are not trapped is shown in green. Note that the percentages
only reflect the filtering that is done by this filter, and do not
take into account any filtering being done by other filter plugins
that are also active.</P>


<P>As with all filter plugins, closing the plugin's window deactives
the filter (but iconifying it does not).</P>
