<A NAME="overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A>

<P>Export some or all of the data in a tabular ASCII file</P>

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>User Interface</H3></A>

<P>The interface is split into four tabs:</P>

<TABLE WIDTH=90%>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="#format"><NOBR>Formatting Options</NOBR></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><I>basic layout options</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="#cols">Column contents</A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><I>choose which Measurements &amp; Spot Attributes to include</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="#rows">Row Contents</A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><I>choose which Names and Name Attrbiutes to use as labels<BR>and choose whuch Measurement Attribute data to include</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="#preview">Preview</A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><I>see a preview of how the file will appear<BR>and optionally adjust the order of the columns</I></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The controls on the first three of these tabs are used to define
which data will be included in the file. The fourth tab displays a
preview of the file contents. Once a satisfactory layout has been
selected, press the "<B>Save</B>" button and use the file chooser that
is then displayed to specify the file location and name.</P>

<P>The <B>Compress with GZIP</B> option employs a common compression
technique to reduce the file size. The <I>Load Plain Text</I> plugin
can load compressed files directly, so this is a convenient way to
save disk space.</P>


<P><HR WIDTH=33%></P>

<H3><A NAME="format">1. Formatting Options</H3>

<P>Use the "<B>Delimiter</B>" drop-down menu to select between tab,
space or comma delimited files.</P>

<P>The "<B>Significant Digits</B>" slider controls the number of decimal
places that will be used for numerical data.</P>

<P>The "<B>Missing value</B>" field allows a custom text string to be
used to represent any missing numerical values.</P>

<P><HR WIDTH=33%></P>

<H3><A NAME="cols">2. Column contents</H3>

<P>The main control on this tab is a list of all Measurements and
optionally the Spot Attributes of these Measurements. Select one or
more items from this list for inclusion in the output file.</P>

<P>The "<B>Include column labels</B>" option determines whether the
names of Measurements and Spot Attributes will be included at the head
of each column.</P>

<P>The "<B>Remove whitespace from labels</B>" option replaces any
whitespace (i.e. space and TAB characters) in column labels with an
underscore character. This is useful if the file is to be parsed by
other software which expects no whitespaces in it's input.</P>


<P><HR WIDTH=33%></P>

<H3><A NAME="rows">3. Row Contents</H3>

<P>The "<B>Apply filter</B>" option restricts the output to only the
Spots not removed by any currently active <A
HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">Filters</A>.</P>


<P>The "<B>Include row labels for Measurement Attributes</B>" controls
whether Measurement Attributes are labelled in the output.</P>

<P>The "<B>Remove white from labels</B>" option replaces any
whitespace (i.e. space and TAB characters) in Measurement Attribute
labels with an underscore character. This is useful if the file is to
be parsed by other software which expects no whitespaces in it's
input.</P>

<P>Select any number of entries from the list of "<B>Spot Names and
Name Attributes</B>" for inclusion in the file.</P>

<P>If any Measurement Attributes exist then they will be displayed in
the list of the right hand side of the tab. Select any number of these
attributes for inclusion in the file. Selected attributes will occur
at the top of the file (as can be seen by examining the preview tab)
</P>

<P><HR WIDTH=33%></P>

<H3><A NAME="preview">4. Preview</H3>

<P>The preview tab shows exactly how the output file will look
(although only the first twenty rows are included in the preview)</P>

<P>Columns in the table can be re-ordered by dragging the column
heading left or right. The columns in the output file will be arranged
in the same order.</P>
