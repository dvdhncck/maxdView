<A NAME="overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A>

<P><I>Read Native</I> imports data from a file using <B>maxdView</B>'s native
file format.</P>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>User Interface</H3></A>

<P>The plugin is based around a normal file browser. By default, the
browser only displays files ending with <TT>.maxd</TT> or
</TT>.maxd.gz</TT></P>

<P>Choose a native file and then press "Open" to start the loading
process. You can double-click on a name to start the load
directly. During the load, a popup dialog shows the progress.</P>

<P>Files in the native file format are generated by the <A
HREF="../../Exporter/WriteNative/WriteNative.html">Write Native</A>
plugin.</P>

<P>The two buttons under <B>Load how?</B> select between replacing the
current data with the contents of the file, or merging it. See the <A
HREF="../../../docs/Merging.html">Merging data</A> help page more
details on how merging is performed.</P>

<P>The buttons under <B>Load what?</B> control which parts of the file
are processed. Unselected buttons cause <I>Read Native</I> to ignore
portions of the file, such as the Clusters or the Colours.</P>
