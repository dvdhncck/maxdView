<P>An interface to other programs or scripts; `Run External' sends
some or all of the data to another program, and then attempts to parse
the results produced by that program.</P>

<P>`Run External' can export one or more Measurements, either to the
standard input of a program, or to a temporary file which the external
program can be told about via a command-line flag.</P>

<P>The output of the program that has been invoked can be grabbed from
the program's standard output, or loaded from a temporary file which
the program has produced.</P>

<A NAME="examples"><H3>Example Definitions</H3></A>


<P>Consider a hypothetical script called "<TT>mean</TT>" which accepts data in
tab separated column form, like this: form:</P>

<PRE>
21431.31    43.21    54352.42   325432.1
213.2143    3232.5   43242.5    3231.23
5121.23     4123.2   54325.12   34.451
</PRE>

<P>and calculates the mean value on each line, producing an output file
like this:</P>

<PRE>
67531.9
41894.256
42783.435
</PRE>

<P>The main thing to notice about this behaviour is that the same
number of lines are output as were input, and that no symbolic names
are present, only numbers. Any program which behaves like this can be
described using the options presented in this example. A more complex
example, in which the number of output lines is not the same as then
number of input lines is described <A HREF="#complex">below</A>.</P>

<P>To interface to this script, the <B>output format</B> selections
should be <NOBR>"Tab delimited"</NOBR>, <NOBR>"One or more
Measurements"</NOBR>, <NOBR>"No name"</NOBR> and the <NOBR><B>input
format</B></NOBR> selections should be <NOBR>"Tab delimited"</NOBR>,
<NOBR>"One Measurement"</NOBR>.</P>

<P>In the case where the script can operate using standard input and
output stream, then no additional description information is
required.</P>

<P>If the script does not understand standard input or output, then a
temporary file can be used for either input or output (or
both). Imagine that the "<TT>mean</TT>" script is normally operated from the
command-line like this:
<TT><PRE>
 host%  ./mean -in my_data.txt -out result.txt
</PRE></TT>

`Run External' can save the input data in a temporary file, called
for example 'temp1', and then execute the command:
<PRE>
 host%  ./mean -in temp1 -out temp2
</PRE>

and, once the "mean" script has completed, read the output data from
the file 'temp2'.</P>

<P>To do this, select 'Temporary file' in both the <B>output
format</B> and <B>input format</B> selections and set the
<B>Arguments</B> text-field to
<PRE> 
   -in %IN -out %OUT
</PRE>

The symbols '%IN' and '%OUT' will be replaced by the temporary
filenames that `Run External' generates when you invoke this
program. You can see these filenames (and change them) in the dialog
box that appears before a program runs (see <A HREF="#run">Part
Three</a> above).</P>
