This plugin carries out a standard Student T Test.
The T Test is often used to assess the significance of a result, especially when sample sizes are small.
The T Test is used to address the following question:
Given two sets of measurements, are the means of the sets significantly different?
Does the difference in the means of the data reflect a real difference in the means
of the underlying distribution, or is the result likely to occur just by chance?
<BR>
Maxd offers two versions of the TTest. The first is the standard t test, for use when both of the sets
considered are assumed to be from normal distributions, and with the added assumption that the
two distributions have the same variance.
<BR>The second version is for use when the distributions are assumed normal, but the variances
are not assumed to be the same.

To perform the t-test:
<UL>
<LI>Pick <B>TTest</B> from the <B> transform</B> menu.
<LI>Choose the measurements for set A and for set B from the two columns.
Hold down the <B>CTRL</B> key to help
select the measurements you require.
<LI>press next.
<LI>On the options tab, select the options you require as follows
<LI> Select the type of T Test you require. The standard t test is for use if you 
assume that the variances are the same, while the <b>vars differ</b> version is for use
when you suspect that the variances may differ for some reason. For microarray 
experiments, the small number of replicates usually mean that it is expedient to assume
that the variances are equal.
<LI>select the action that you wish the program to take when some but not all of the 
measurements for a particular spot are NaN (not a number). This is a case which could occur if there
has been a problem on one or two of the replicates for that spot. It could also occur if 
the user has purposefully set to NaN those measurements which have been flagged as not working.
The first option here is "set to NaN", in which case the t test is not carried out for that spot,
and the t and p values in the result column will be set to NaN. The second option is
"calculate using remaining values." In this case, the program will ignore the NaN values, and 
will carry out a t test only on the remaining values for that spot. 
<LI>Check boxes in order to select which columns you wish to create.
<LI>Change the names of the columns if you wish.
<LI>Press "press t test".
</UL>
On completing the T Test the program will display an info message confirming which measurements were 
used in the calculation.
<BR>
Note: If the "calculate using remaining values" option is chosen,
the user is recommended not to rely only on the t value column when interpreting the results. 
For spots where the t value has been calculated using different numbers of results, 
the number of degrees of freedom will differ, so the t values will not be directly comparable.
The p values are calculated taking into consideration the number of degrees of freedom, so the p 
values will be directly comparable. The user is thus reccomended to include the p value column and/or
the degrees of freedom column in this case
<BR>
Note: When analysing microarray data, one is usually interested in the 2 tailed p-value.
This is the probablility that a difference in means greater than that reported might occur by chance.
This includes both cases, meanA>meanB and meanB>meanA.
The one tailed p value is used only in the case where our a priori belief is that meanA>meanB.

<A NAME="formula"><H3>Formulae and Explanation</H3></A>
The assumptions which are made in order to carry out a t test are:
<UL>
<LI>That the distributions of values follow a normal (gaussian) distribution
<LI>That the true variances of the two distributions are the same
</UL>


The formula for the T Test is as follows:
<PRE>
	t = differenceOfMeans / sterrOfDifferences
</PRE>
where
<PRE>
	differenceOfMeans = mean(A) - mean(B)
</PRE>
and 
<PRE>
	sterrOfDiffences = sqrt(alpha * beta)
	
	alpha = (1/n(A)) + 1/n(B))

 	beta = (var(A)*(n(A)-1) + var(B)*(n(B)-1)) / (n(A) + n(B) -2)
</PRE>
recall that:
<PRE>
	mean(x) = Sum(x)/n(x)

	var(x) = Sum((x-mean(x))^2) / (n(x)-1)
</PRE>
Note that if both of the samples have the same number of elements, say n, then the formula for
the value of t is reduced to:
<PRE>
	(mean(A) - mean(B)) / sqrt ((var(A) + var(B))/n )
</PRE>
In order to interpret the t value, need to look on a statistical table to determine the 
p-value cutoff which corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom and the required
statistical significance. 

<BR>

Note that the number of degrees of freedom is:

<PRE>
	n(A) + n(B) - 2

</PRE>

The above explanation and the t test in maxd are for the case where the variances of the two distributions
are assumed to be the same.
<BR>

One can still apply a significance test if the variances are assumed to be different.
In that case, the value calculated is given by:

<PRE>
	d = mean(A) - mean(B) / sqrt(var(A)/n(A) + var(B)/n(B))
</PRE>

the effective number of degrees of freedom in this case is given by 

<PRE>
	degFreedom = (u^2/(n(A)-1) + (1-u)^2/(n(B)-1))^(-1)
</PRE>

where 

<PRE>
	u = var(A)/n(A) / (var(A)/n(A) + var(B)/n(B))
</PRE>

the significance cutoff can be obtained from relavant tables by considering the nearest integer values
to the effective degrees of freedom.
<BR>
Maxd will calculate the P value for the given t statistic and number of degrees of freedom.
A low P value indicates a result which was unlikey to occur just by chance, and can be interpreted 
as a high probability that means of the underlying distributions differ to the extent reported.
