<A NAME="overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A>

<P>The Weka machine learning package provides four clustering methods,
"Cobweb", "Estimation Maximisation", "Simple K-Means" and "Farthest
First". For more details on the algorithms used, see the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/index.html">Weka
documentation.</A></P>


<P>The plugin requires the file "<TT>weka.jar</TT>" which can be
downloaded from the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/index.html">Weka</A> web
site. The file is distributed in a package called
<TT>weka-3-4.jar</TT> (although newer versions made be
available). <B>Unpack this file</B> as per the supplied instructions. Start
the <I>Weka Clustering</I> plugin and when it states that it cannot
find the Weka classes, pick the "Find" option and use the file chooser
to specify the location of the file "<TT>weka.jar</TT>".</P>

<P>Note: These clustering algorithms can be very time consuming for
large datasets. Using the <A
HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">Filter</A>(s) to hide uninteresting
Spots before clustering can be very beneficial.</P>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>User Interface</H3></A>

<P>Clustering can be done on either Spots (i.e. finding genes with
similar profiles ) or Measurements (i.e. finding experiments or
organisms with similar profiles).</P>

<P>Each Measurement is represented with a checkbox. Use these to
select which Measurements will be passed to the clustering
algorithm.</P>

<P><B>Apply filter</B> restricts the clustering to the Spots which
pass through the current <A
HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">Filter</A>(s).</P>


<P>Two tabs contain the controls for the different clustering
algorithms. Consult the Weka documentation for full details.</P>

<P>The clustering process takes place in a separate thread. You can
continue to use other features of <B>maxdView</B> whilst the
clustering is under way, but take care not to load new data points
until the clustering has finshed.</P>
