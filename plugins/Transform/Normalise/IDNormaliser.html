<A NAME="overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A>

<P> Systematic bias in microarray data may be due to many sources. In particular for two colour 
microarray data (using typically Cy3 and Cy5 fluors) the log ratio values may show a systematic trend that 
is dependent on the total log intensity. Such systematic trends can detected using "M-A" plots. 
If for a two colour microarray experiment R and G represent the red and green channel intensities 
respectively, then M and A are defined as,</P>

<P> M = log(R) - log(G) </P>
<P> A = 0.5 * [log(R) + log(G)]</P>

<P> M is simply the log ratio, i.e. log(R/G), whilst A is the average (over channels) of logged 
intensities. We would not necessarily expect the log ratio, M, to depend upon the precise value of A. Thus 
any general trend in a plot of M against A would indicate a systematic intensity dependent bias.</P>

<P>The intensity dependent bias can be removed by first estimating the general trend in the M-A scatter plot 
and then defining normalised log-ratios as the difference between the raw, un-normalised log ratio and the 
general trend. The mean normalised log-ratio will be essentially set to zero. If this assumption is 
not valid you may wish to consider using a different normalisation algorithm.</P>

<P> One of the most popular methods for calculating the general trend in the M-A scatter plot is lowess 
(Locally Weighted Regression), sometimes also referred to as loess. This calculates the general non-linear 
trend using a series of short straight line fits to local sections of the data. For more details see 
Yang <I>et. al.</I> (2002) <I>Nucl. Acid. Res.</I> <B>30</B>:e15</P>

<P><B>Notes</B></P>

<P>When working with a large number of spots the lowess calculation can be time consuming. Therefore rather 
than performing a locally weighted regression at every value of A in the raw data (i.e. for 
every spot), we perform a locally weighted regression at every centile of A in the data. For spots 
with values of A between centiles, the general trend in the scatter plot is defined to be on the 
straight line segment resulting from the locally weighted regression performed at the nearest centile. </P>

<P> The lowess algorithm currently implemented uses a tri-cube kernel with a span corresponding to 
30% of the data. Three iterations of the robust version of the lowess algorithm are performed, with a 
bi-square kernel on the dependent variable, i.e. M. In future releases it is hoped to make these 
parameter settings accessible to the user through the "Advanced Options" control panel.</P>

<P>The intensity dependent normalisation methods return normalised log-ratios. All logarithms are natural 
logarithms, i.e. logarithms to base <I>e</I>.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="NormaliseIntensityDependent1.gif"></P>

<P>Select Measurements to normalise from the list on the left-hand side of the
panel.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="NormaliseIntensityDependent2.gif"></P>

<P> Choose the "red channel" from the list of pre-selected Measurements. Similarly choose the 
"green channel" data.</P>
<P>Choose the smoothing method. The current default method is "loess". </P>
<P>Choose whether to create new Measurements in the main table, or overwrite the Measurements 
selected with the normalised data.</P> 

<P>If the "Show MA plot after normalisation" option is checked the M-A plots of the raw and normalised data 
will appear.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="NormaliseIntensityDependent3.gif"></P>

<P>The left hand plot shows the un-normalised data, with the black points indicating the lowess smoothed 
values at each centile. The right hand plot shows the normalised log-ratios.</P>
