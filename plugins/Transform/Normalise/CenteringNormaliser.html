<P> Centering of logged microarray data is one of the simplest normalisation methods and one of the 
first developed. It is typically applied to a ratio of intensities such as one might obtain from a 
two colour spotted cDNA microarray experiment. The underlying assumption is that, between the two 
mRNA populations being compared using the ratios, no overall differential expression has occurred, i.e. 
on average just as much up regulation has occurred as down regulation. This is equivalent to an assumption 
that the total amount of mRNA is the same between the two mRNA populations. If these assumptions do 
not apply to your data, e.g. there is a significant level of overall of differential expression between 
the two mRNA populations, then another normalisation method may be more appropriate.</P>

<P> If the assumption of no overall differential expression is valid then the average log ratio of 
mRNA abundances should be zero. The average log ratio of measured (raw, un-normalised) intensities may not 
be zero. This difference is due to bias, which the normalisation method attempts to eliminate. 
This is done by subtracting the average log ratio of intensities from all the log ratios, i.e. centering 
the distribution of log ratios over a mean value of zero.</P>

<P> Two different centering methods are provided within MaxD - mean and median centering. Mean 
centering sets the mean of the logged data to zero. Calculation of the average or mean of a quantity can be
significantly affected by large outliers and may be an unreliable estimate of the center of a distribution. 
The median of data set is a quantity that is less affected by outliers and so is a more <I>robust</I> 
estimate of the center of a distribution. The median centering method sets the median of the logged data to 
zero. Due to the more robust nature of the median, median centering is the default (recommended) centering 
method.</P>

<P><B>Notes</B></P>

<P>The centering methods center the logged data that is given to them. The logarithms are taken within the 
normalisation method. If you wish to apply mean/median centering to ratios of intensities, you must 
calculate the ratios first (e.g. using the "Simple Maths" menu option on the "Transform" menu) 
before using the normalisation algorithm.</P>

<P>The centering normalisation methods return normalised logged data. All logarithms are natural 
logarithms, i.e. logarithms to base <I>e</I>.</P>

<P>Select Measurements to normalise from the list on the left-hand side of the
panel.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="NormaliseCentering2.gif"></P>

<P> Choose the centering method (mean or median). Choose threshold value - any raw data values below the 
threshold will be set to the threshold before taking logarithms. Choose whether to create new Measurements 
in the main table, or overwrite the Measurements selected with the normalised data.</P>
