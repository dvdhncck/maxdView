<A NAME="overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A>

<P>This plugin performs a normalisation of one or more
Measurements. </P>

<P>For documentation on the individual methods that are supported,
select the desired method and press the "Help" button again.</P>


<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>User Interface</H3></A>

<P>The interface is divided into two panels which are accessed in
sequence:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#pick">"Pick Measurements" panel</A>
<LI><A HREF="#norm">"Normalise" panel</A>
</UL>
<P>&nbsp</P>

<A NAME="pick"><H3>Pick Measurements</H3></A>

<P>Use the first panel to select one or more Measurements. You can
exclude one or more Spots from the normalisation process by trapping
them with a <A HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">filter</A>.</P>

<P>Press the "<B>Next</B>" button to move to the next panel.</P>

<P>&nbsp</P>

<A NAME="norm"><H3>Normalise</H3></A>

<P>Normalisation can be performed either "<B>In place</B>" in which
case the values in the existing Measurements are changed, or as
"<B>Create new</B>" in which case a new Measurement is made for each
of the Measurements selected for normalisation.</P>
