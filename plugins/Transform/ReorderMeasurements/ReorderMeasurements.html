<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>This plugin lets you change the order in which Measurements are
stored. This will change the order in which they are displayed in the
main plot window (and in other viewers which consider the
ordering).</P>

<P>The order can be changed manually by dragging the Measurements left
or right in the display, or it can be automatically computed using the
names of the Measurments or the values of one of the Measurement
Attributes.</P>

<H3>User Interface</H3>

<P>Each of the Measurements in the data is represented by a icon in the panel,
these icons can be dragged into new positions using the mouse.</P>

<P>The "<B>Sort by Name</B>" button arranges in the Measurements in
alphabetical order of their names.</P>

<P>The "<B>Sort by Attribute</B>" button displays a list of all of the
Measurement Attributes in the data and once one is chosen, arranges in
the Measurements in alphabetical order of the values of that
Attribute.</P>

<P>Once you are happy with the new order, use the 'Apply' button to
commit the changes. Use the 'Cancel' button to discard any changes you
have made.</P>
