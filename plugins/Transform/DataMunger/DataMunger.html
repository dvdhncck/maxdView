<A NAME="overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A>

<P>The <I>Data Munger</I> plugin creates new Measurements or Spot
Attributes based on an existing data. The values from the existing
data are copied to to the Measurement or Spot
Attribute for all Spots except those which have been filtered. The
values for the filtered Spots are set to a user-specified value.</P>

<P>The purpose of this plugin is to assist in 'tidying up' data, for
example, setting the expression value to '0' in all cases where it is
'less than 100'.</P>

<P><I>Data Munger</I> must be used in conjuction with <A
HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">filters</A> to determine which
subset of the Spots should have their values altered.</P>

<HR>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>User Interface</H3></A>

<P>The user interface is divided into three sections: </P>

<P><UL>
<LI><P><B>Select the source 'Measurement' or 'Spot Attribute'</B></P>

<P>
Use the drop-down list to pick either a Measurement or a
SpotAttribute. The SpotAttributes are listed after the Measurement to
which they belong.
</P>

<LI><P><B>Choose which Spots to affect</B></P>

<P>
Select either to alter the values for Spots which are filtered, or for
those which are not filtered.
</P>

<LI><P><B>Specify how the values are to be changed</B></P>

<P>
The values that will be changed can either be set to 'NaN' (the special
<I>Not-a-Number</I> value which indicates a missing number) or to some 
numerical value.
</P>

</UL></P>

<H3>Examples:</H3>


<TABLE WIDTH="90%" ALIGN="CENTER"><TR><TD>

<P>Create a new Measurement which is the same as Measurement
'A' except that all values which are greater than 1000 will be clamped
to 1000</P>

<TABLE WIDTH="90%" ALIGN="CENTER"><TR><TD>

<UL>
<P><LI>Set up a <A
HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">filter</A> that selects Spots in
which the value in Measurement 'A' are greater than 1000. (The
<I>MathFilter</I> is ideal for this task).</P>

<P><LI>Start the <I>Data Munger</I> plugin and select 'A' as the source
Measurement.</P>

<P><LI>Select 'Change the value in all unfiltered Spots'. This ensures
that the hidden Spots (i.e. those in which the values are 1000 or
less) which not be affected.</P>

<P><LI>Select the  'Change values to' button and enter the value '1000'
into the type-in box.</P>

<P><LI>Press "<B>Execute</B>" and provide a  name for the new Measurement.</P>
