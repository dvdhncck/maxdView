<A NAME="overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A>

<P>This plugin provides an interface to the XCluster software by Gavin
Sherlock, for details of the parameters see the <A
HREF="http://www.genome.stanford.edu/"> XCluster website</A>.</P>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>User Interface</H3></A>

<P>Clustering can be done on either Spots (i.e. finding genes with
similar profiles ) or Measurements (i.e. finding experiments or
organisms with similar profiles).</P>

<P>All Measurements is displayed in a list. Use `shift-click' or
`ctrl-click' to select one or more Measurements to be passed to the
clustering algorithm.</P>

<P><B>Apply filter</B> restricts the clustering to the Spots which
pass through the current <A
HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">Filter</A>(s).</P>

<P>The clustering process takes place in a separate thread. You can
continue to use other features of <B>maxdView</B> whilst the
clustering is under way, but take care not to load new data points
until the clustering has finshed.</P>

<P>The controls and parameters are organised in three groups:</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Options</B></DT> 

<DD><P>This panel is used to specify where the XCluster package has
been installed and where temporary files should be stored.</P>

<P>The "<B>Location of Cluster program</b>" field should
contain the full path to the `<TT>cluster</TT>' binary,
e.g. <TT>/usr/local/apps/xcluster/cluster</TT>.</P>

<P>The "<B>Directory for temporary files</B>" field can optionally
give the path of a directory in which files can be stored. Tempoprary
files are used to communicate data from <B>maxdView</B> to
`XCluster'. If this field is left blank then the directory where
<B>maxdView</B> is installed will be used.</P>

<P>The "<B>Delete after use</B>" option refers to the temporary files
and should normally be switched on (unless you wish to manually
inspect the output of the `XCluster' for some reason).</P></DD>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<DT><B>Partition</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>This panel is used to select which (if any) of two possible
partitioning schemes to use whilst clustering.</P>

<P>"<B>No partition</B>" results in normal hierarchical clustering.</P>

<P>"<B>K-means</B>" attempts to group the data into a fixed number of
categories, each of which is organised by a separate hierarchical
clustering.</P>

<P>"<B>Self-Organising-Map</B>" attempts to group the data into
categories as with k-means. Here the categories are further organised
into a grid arranged by their similarity with one another.</P>
</DD>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<DT><B>Cluster</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>This panel contains options used by XCluster when determining how
similar one Spot or Measurement is to another one. The options are
explained fully in the documentation that accompanies 'XCluster'.</P>

<P>"<B>Pearson corelation</B>"</P>

<P>"<B>Euclidean distance</B>"</P>

<P>"<B>Centered distance</B>"</P>

<P>"<B>Log transform data</B>"</P>

</DD>
</DL>
