<A NAME="overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A>

<P>The <I>Just-O-Clust</I> plugin attempts to `justify' clusters of
Spots by finding repeated words in the text linked to them.</P>

<P>Words can be extracted from the Gene or Probe <A
HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#spot">names</A> and <A
HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#spot">name attributes</A>, or from
the <A HREF="../../../docs/AnnotationLoader.html">annotation</A>
linked to the names.</P>

<P>The plugin then generates a display showing how words are repeated
in the contents of each cluster.</P>

<HR>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>User Interface</H3></A>

<P>The interface is divided into three panels which are accessed in
sequence:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#pick">Pick cluster</A>
<LI><A HREF="#set">Set options</A>
<LI><A HREF="#view">View results</A>
</UL>

<A NAME="pick"><H3>Pick cluster</H3></A>

<P>Select a cluster for justification. You can pick any cluster from the
tree or use <A
HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#drag">drag-and-drop</A> to transfer
a cluster from another viewer.</P>

<P>Use the "<B>Next</B>" button to advance to the next panel.</P>

<A NAME="set"><H3>Set options</H3></A>

<UL>
<LI><P><B>Word source</B>: this menu allows to you to select one of
the names or name attributes to use as a source of words. The menu
also has an "Annotation" option which specifies that text from the
annotation cache should be used instead.</P>

<LI><P><B>Delimiters</B>: specify characters used to split text
strings into individua l words. </P>

<P>The text from source specified in "<B>Word source</B>" is converted
into words using the "<B>Delimiters</B>". These characters are used to
identify the start of a new word in a text string. The
"<B>Delimiters</B>" string usually includes characters such as " "
(space) and "," comma. You can customise the "<B>Delimiters</B>" to
suit the text you have.</P>

<P>For example: using the delimiters "<TT> ,:</TT>" (i.e. a space, a
comma and a colon) the string "<TT>one:red, two:green,
three:blue</TT>" is converted into six words ('<TT>one</TT>',
<TT>red</TT>', '<TT>two</TT>', etc.) If the delimiters string does not
contain a "<TT>:</TT>" then the example string will be converted into
three words ('<TT>one:red</TT>' etc.).</P>

<P>You can use RETURN and TAB as delimiters by refering to them as
'\n' and '\t' respectively.</P>

<LI><P><B>Min word length</B>: Words shorter than this length will be ignored </P>

<LI><P><B>Detect words as substrings</B>: When enabled, words which
occur as substrings in other words will be counted identically,
otherwise they will be treated as different words. </P>

<P>For example, with this mode enabled, "nonhuman" and "subhuman" will
both match as "human". With this mode disabled these three words will
be treated differently.</P>

<LI><P><B>Case sensitive</B>: When enabled, the case of the text is
considered during matching, otherwise upper- and lower-case characters
are identical.</P>

<LI><P><B>Stop words</B>: A list of words which should be
ignored. This button opens an editor for the list of stop words. Words
in the "<B>Word source</B>" which have been identified as stop words
will not be counted or displayed in the results.</P>

<LI><P><B>Translations</B>: A translation table recording pairs of
words that are synonyms. This opens an editor for the list of
translations. Each translation is two words (called 'from' and 'to').
Words in the "<B>Word source</B>" which match a 'from' word are
translated to the corresponding 'to' word.</P>

<P>The translation table is useful when the text sources use several
different terms or abbreviations for the same thing.</P>

</UL>

<P>Use the "<B>Next</B>" button to advance to the next panel and the
"<B>Back</B>" button to return to the "Pick Cluster" panel.</P>

<P><A NAME="view"><H3>View results</H3></A></P>

<P>The results of the word matching are displayed in a scrollable
panel. The selected cluster and it's children are laid out left to
right. </P>

<P>The panel on the left hand side can display either a tree of
clusters or a list of all of the repeated words.</P>

<P>When the cluster tree is displayed clicking on a cluster in the
tree scolls the right hand panel to display that cluster.</P>

<P>When the list of words is displayed clicking on a word selects
that word causing a line to be drawn following the occurrences of the
word in the cluster hierarchy.</P>

<P>One box like that seen below is displayed for the cluster that you
<A HREF="#pick">picked</A> and one for each of its descendants. Each
box contains one line for each words that is repeated in text linked
to spots in that cluster. Next to the word is displayed the percentage
of spots in the cluster which contain that word. If for example all
spots in a cluster have the word "protein" in their text then this
word will appear at the top of the list with "100%" beside it. </P>

<P>Note that the percentage results for parent clusters are inclusive
of the results of their children (and grandchildren and so on).</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG
SRC="JustOClustClusterBox.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>The above example shows the repeated words in a cluster called
"k=4". The total number of spots in the cluster and all of its
descendants is shown in brackets beside the name. </P>

<P>This cluster contains 80 spots. From the word source for those
spots 15 words have been found to occur in more than one Spot. The
repeated words are shown, ranked by the percentage of spots containing
the word.</P>

<P>In this example the word "pathway" has been found in 17.5% of the
spots and "complex" in 15% of the Spots.  On each line, beside the
percentage, is a small button which opens window containing more
detailed results. </P>

<P><CENTER><IMG
SRC="JustOClustViewDetails.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>This popup window shows which of the spots contained
the word, and shows the chunk of text in which word occurred.</P>

<P>&nbsp</P>

<A NAME="example"><H3>Example</H3></A>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="JustOClustExample.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>The above picture shows a simple cluster hierarchy containing eight
spots. Cluster names are shown in blue. Text information about each
spot is stored the "Gene.Description" name attribute.</P>

<P>If the <I>Just-o-Clust</I> is let loose on this example then the
output would be:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>"A": zinc 36.7%, protein 50%<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<NOBR><FONT SIZE="-1">(because 'zinc' occurs in 3 of
the 8 spots and 'protein' in 4 of 8)</FONT></NOBR></P>
<LI><P>"B": zinc 66.6%<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<NOBR><FONT SIZE="-1">('zinc' occurs in 2 of the 3 spots)</FONT></NOBR></P>
<LI><P>"C": protein 60%<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<NOBR><FONT SIZE="-1">('protein' in 3 of the 5 spots)</FONT></NOBR></P>
<LI><P>"D": no repeats</P>
<LI><P>"E": protein 66.6%<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<NOBR><FONT SIZE="-1">('protein' in 2 of the 3 spots)</FONT></NOBR></P>
