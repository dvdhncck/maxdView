<h4>Labelling a single item:</h4>

<P>Click on any dot in the plot window to toggle display of a name

<h4>Labelling several things at once:</h4>

<P>The 'Select' mouse mode is used to add labels to a collection of
nearby items. In 'Select' mode, pressing and holding the left mouse
button whilst dragging the mouse draws a box which can be used to
select a region. When the mouse button is released all items within
this region will be given labels.</P>

<h4>Label Controls:</h4>

<P>Any <A HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#names">Spot Name or
Attribute</A> can be used for the labels. The first drop-down menu at
the bottom of the window is used to select which name or name
attribute to display as labels.</P>

<P>The second drop-down menu contains several commands for controling
label display:</P>

<LI>Label all visible items
<LI>Clear all labels
<LI>Label all items
<LI>Select all labelled items

moves the display back after a zoom operation. Repeated presses of
this button step backwards through the sequence of zooms or pans.</P>

<h4>Resetting the view:</h4>

<P>The <B>Reset view</B> button adjusts the scale so that all Spots
are visible in all plots.</P>

<P><B>Auto reset view</B> causes the
view to rescale itself when changing from one Measurement to
another. When this switch is off, the view position and scaling is
unchanged when switching between Measurements.</P>

<P>&nbsp</P>

<A NAME="locate"><P><H3><B>Locating Spots or Measurements</B></H3></P></A>

<P><A HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#drag">Drag-and-drop</A> can be
used to locate particular Spots or Measurements in the plot. Drag a
Spot or Measuremenr from the main display and drop it into the
<I>Scatter Plot</I> window and the name will appear next to it on the
plot. Dropping a Cluster onto the panel causes the names of all Spots
or Measurement in the cluster to be displayed.</P>

<A NAME="plots"><P><H3><B>Displaying more than one plot</B></H3></P></A>

<I>Scatter Plot</I> can display multiple plots at the same time. The
'add plot' button (represented as a "+") appears to the left of the
plot control panel (at the top of the window).</P>

<P>The initial settings for a newly added plot are exactly the same as
the existing plot. A new set of controls appears in the panel at the
top of the window (the slider may have to be adjusted for these
controls to become visible).</P>

<P>When more than one plot is enabled, extra controls appear to the
left of each of the plot control panels. These buttons are used to
raise and lower a plot in the list (plots are drawn from
top-to-bottom) and to delete a plot (the "X" icon).</P>

<P>&nbsp</P>

<A NAME="axes"><P><H3><B>Controlling the axes</B></H3></P></A>

The axis scaling, labelling and title can be controlled via the panel
that is displayed when the "Axes" button is pressed. More information
