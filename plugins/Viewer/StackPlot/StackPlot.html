<P>Show the co-relation between two measurements on a 2&frac12;D plot</P>

<P>The Stack Plot is so-called because it stacks up multiple spots
which fall into the same bin. Bins are created by dividing the range
of data in a Measurement into a number of discrete chunks.</P>

<HR>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>User Interface</H3></A>

<P>The configuration of X and Y axes is done by the two sets of controls
in the top left corner of the window. The controls (from left to
right) for each axis are the same; three drop-down menus:

<UL>
<LI>Measurement
<LI>Number of bins - choose from a preset selection of sizes
<LI>Boundary mode - either equally filled or equally spaced
</UL>
</P>

<P>A scrollbar on the left-hand side on the window controls the global
scale of the stacks. When set to zero, i.e. fully down, the stack plot
becomes completely 2D.</P>

<P>A set of checkboxes in the top-right corner control additional
features:
<TABLE>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><B>Use filter</B><TD> selects between showing all of the data
or only showing the data items which pass through the current <A
HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">Filter</A>.</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><B>Auto reset view</B><TD> causes the
view to rescale itself when changing from one Measurement to
another. When this switch is off, the view position and scaling is
unchanged when swtching between Measurements.</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><B>Auto levelise</B><TD> mode updates
the bin boundaries to attempt to more evenly distribute the data. This
option is only available when both axes are in <I>equally filled</I> mode</TR>
</TABLE>
