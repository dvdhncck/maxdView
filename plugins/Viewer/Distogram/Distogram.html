<P>The <I>Distogram</I> plugins can display a variety of distribution
histograms for one or more Measurements.</P>

<P>Values are discretised into a
number of bins, and a graph showing the number of values falling into
each bin is displayed. The plot auto-scales to accomodate the values
currently displayed. </P>

<P>The control panel contains (from top to bottom):</P>

<UL>
<P><LI>
A label showing how many bins are being used in the discretisation
process. The <B>More</B> and <B>Less</B> buttons below this label
allow you to increase and decrease the number of bins.</P>

<P><LI>
The <B>Cumulative</B> checkbox toggles between displaying the
distribution(s) in the normal fashion, or as a cumulative graph (in
which each bin is the sum of the spots in that bin, and the of the the
spots in bins to the left of it).</P>

<P><LI>
One checkbox for each Measurement in the data. The checkbox also
shows which colour has been allocated to that Measurement. Colours are
allocated sequentially using a predefined colour scheme that cannot be
changed. In you really want to change colours, you can use <A
HREF="../../Transform/ReorderMeasurements/ReorderMeasurements.html">Reorder
Measurements</A> to change which colour gets allocated to which
measurement.</P>

<P><LI>
Under the list of Measurements are two buttons, <B>All</B> switches
on display of all Measurements, and <B>None</B> switches them all off.</P>

<P><LI>
<B>Apply filter</B> selects between showing the distribution
all of the data or that of only the data items which pass through the
current <A
HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">Filter</A>(s).</P>
