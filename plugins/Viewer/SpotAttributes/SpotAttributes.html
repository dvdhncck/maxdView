<CENTER><IMG SRC="SpotAttributes.jpg"></CENTER>

<P>One of three possible lists can be displayed on the left-hand side of the panel:

<TABLE WIDTH=95%>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>Names &amp; Name Attrs&nbsp;</TD><TD><I>a list of all Names and Name Attributes</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>Measurements&nbsp;</TD><TD><I>a list of all Measurements</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>Spot Attrs&nbsp;</TD><TD><I>a list of all Spot Attributes (which occur in one or more Measurement)</I></TD></TR>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</P>

<P>The three buttons above the list control which of the lists is
currently displayed. The "<B>All</B>" and "<B>None</B>" buttons select
all entries in the current list or none of the entries in the current
list respectively.</P>

<P>The right-hand side of the panel contains a table which displays
the currently selected data. Nothing will appear in the table until at
least one Measurement has been selected.</P>

<P>Any number of Names and Name Attributes can be selected for
inclusion in the table.</P>

<P>Any number of Spot Attributes can be selected. A column is added to
the table for each of the chosen Spot Attributes are added to the
table which occurs in each of the selected Measurements.</P>

<P>The columns in the able can be re-ordered by dragging their
headings left or right. The width of individual columns can be changed
by dragging the edges of the column heading left or right.</P>

<P>The "<B>Apply filter</B>" option can be activated to remove Spots
which are trapped by the current <A
HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">filter(s)</A> from the table.</P>

<P>The "<B>Delete</B>" button permanently removes the currently selected
SpotAttributes from the currently selected Measurements. Any
combination of SpotAttributes and Measurements can be used, for
example deleting one SpotAttribute from all Measurements, or deleting
all SpotAttributes from a single Measurement.</P>


<P>The "<B>Rename</B>" button allows the currently selected
SpotAttribute to be renamed in the currently selected
Measurements. Only one SpotAttribute can be renamed at a time, but the
name can be changed in any combination of the Measurements. Renaming a
SpotAttribute does not alter the data or the datatype of the
SpotAttribute.</P>


<P><HR WIDTH=33%></P>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>Options</H3></A>

<P>The "<B>Options</B>" button opens a dialog box containing a number of switches:</P>

<UL>
<P><LI>The "<B>Synchronise the Spot selection</B>" option keeps the row selection in
the table synchronised with the current <A
HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#selection">Spot selection</A>. </P>

<P><LI>The "<B>Synchronise the Measurement selection</B>" option keeps
the selection in the Measurement list synchronised with the current <A
HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#selection">Measurement
selection</A>. </P>

<P><LI>The "<B>Always display the Measurement values</B>" option controls
whether the expression values of selected Measurements are displayed
in the table. When unselected, only Spot Attribute values are
displayed.</P>

<P><LI>The "<B>Expand SpotAttribute Names</B>" option determines whether
Spot Attribute names are prefixed with the name of the Measurement
they belong to.</P>

<P><LI>When the "<B>Group SpotAttribute columns together</B>" option is
selected, Spot Attributes columns are grouped together, when this
option is not selected then Spot Attributes are grouped with the
Measurement they belong to. </P>

<P><LI>The "<B>Attempt to remember column layout</B>" option controls how the order of the columns in the table is maintained when columns are added or removed. When selected, the order is preserved as columms are added or removed, when unselected, the order is defined by the current Measurement order.</P>

<P><LI>When the "<B>Attempt to remember column width</B>" option is
selected, the width of columns is preserved as columns are added to or
removed from the table. When unselected, column widths are reset
whenever the table is altered.</P>
