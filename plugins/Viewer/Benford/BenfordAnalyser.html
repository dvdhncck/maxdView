<P>The distribution of 1st significant digits in many real data sets is not uniform, 
but follows Benford's law (F. Benford, ,<I>Proc. Am. Phil. Soc.</I>, <B>78</B> (1938), pp551-572). 
In base 10 Benford's law says the probability, P(D), of D being the 1st significant digit is,</P>
<BR>
P(D) = log<SUB>10</SUB>(1 + D<SUP>-1</SUP>)
<BR>

<P>This curious statistical law, actually first noted by 
Newcomb (S. Newcomb, <I>Amer. J. Math.</I>, <B>4</B> (1881), pp39-40), 
says that numbers whose 1st significant digit is 1 occur approximately 
30% of the time, whilst those whose 1st significant digit is 9 occur approximately 
5% of the time. It has been noted recently (D.C. Hoyle et al, <I>Bioinformatics</I>, <B>18</B> 
(2002), to appear) 
that spot intensities from microarray experiments follow Benford's law very closely. This application 
plots the frequency, f<SUB>D</SUB>, of 1st significant digits for the selected data set and compares it to 
Benford's law. 
The chi-squared statistic indicates the amount of agreement. The smaller the chi-squared value is, 
the closer the agreement between the observed distribution of 1st significant digits and Benford's law.</P>

<P>
The frequencies of 1st significant digits are calculated for the Measurement selected by the user from the 
list of Measurements on the left hand side of the User-Interface. The frequencies are displayed in the graph 
on the right hand side of the User-Interface. The Benford's law distribution is also shown on the graph as 
a solid line. The chi-squared value, measuring the degree of agreement between the distribution of 
1st significant digits in the selected Measurement and Benford's law, is shown above the graph.</P>
