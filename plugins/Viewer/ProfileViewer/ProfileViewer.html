<A NAME="overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A>

<P>This plugin displays one or more groups of 'expression
profiles'. An expression profiles is a line which represents how the
expression value for a Spot changes across Measurements. A single
group of hand picked Spots can be displayed, or groups can be
generated from a cluster hierarchy. </P>

<P>The expression profiles are essentially the same visualisation as
that given by the <A HREF="../WebPlot/WebPlot.html">Web Plot</A>. The
difference with this plugin is that the grouping of Spots into
Clusters can also be displayed.</P>


<P>In "Cluster" mode you can select one or more Clusters from a tree
or use <A
HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#drag"><I>drag-and-drop</I></a> to
move Clusters from other parts of <B>maxdView</B>.

<P>You can '<A HREF="#drill">drill down</A>' into a Cluster by clicking on the glyph drawn
on the top-right on each graph.</P>

<P>In "Spot" mode you can select one or more Spots from an
alphabetically spoted list of <A
HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#spots">Names or Name
Attributes</A>. Again, <A
HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#drag"><I>drag-and-drop</I></a> can
be used to select Spots in the list. Dropping a Cluster onto the list
will select all Spots in that Cluster (and it's descendants). </P>

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>User Interface</H3></A>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="ProfileViewer.jpg"></P></CENTER>

<P>The plugin is split into three areas:<P>

<OL>
<LI><P>The Measurement selection area with which you select two or
more Measurements to include in the profile.</P>

<LI><P>The Cluster selection area with which you select one or more
Clusters to draw profiles for.</P>

<LI><P>The visualisation panel in which the profiles appear. There
will be one graph for each selected Cluster. The name of the Cluster
and the number of Spot profiles is shown above each graph.</P>
 
</OL>

<P>When the <B>Include children</B> option is selected, each graph
will include the Spots from the Cluster and all of it's children,
otherwise just the Spots in the Cluster itself are displayed.</P>

<P>The <B>Show mean</B> option toggles between showing profiles for
each Spot in the Cluster or calculating a mean profile for all Spots
in the Cluster. When the mean profiles are displayed, error bars are
included show the minimum and maximum values along the profile</P>

<P>The <B>Apply filter</B> option selects between showing all of the
Spots in selected Clusters, or only showing the Spots which pass
through the current <A HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">filter(s)</A>.</P>

<P>The <B>Uniform scale</B> option determines whether all graphs are
drawn to the same scale or whether each graph is allowed to optimise
it's scale to the range of the data it is displaying.</P>

<P>The Cluster selection panel has a shortcut feature. Select a
Cluster, then press a number key '1',..,'9' to expand the tree to the
specified depth. Press '0' to collapse the branches of the selected
Cluster.</P>

<P>You can use <A
HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#drag"><I>drag-and-drop</I></A> to move Clusters to the Cluster
selection panel and Measurement Names to the Measurement selection
panel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<A NAME="spots"><H3>Identifying Spot Profiles:</H3></A>

<P>When the mouse pointer is rested over a profile for a moment, a
tool-tip window appears containing an identification label. This label
can be any of the <A HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#spot">Name or
Name Attributes</A> in the current data. The choice of which Name or
Name Attribute to show is made via the drop-down menu in the control
bar along the top of the window.</P>

<P>Click on a profile to add a name label to the plot. Click on the
profile again to remove the label. The "<B>Clear all</B>" button
removes all name labels that have been added to the plot. The
"<B>Label all</B>" button adds labels to all Spot profiles which are
currently displayed.</P>

<P>The size of the label font can be adjusted using the "<B>a+</B>"
and "<B>a-</B>" buttons.</P>

<P><A HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#drag">Drag-and-drop</A> can be
used to locate particular Spots in the plot. Drag one or more Spots
from the main display and drop them into the <I>HyperCube Plot</I>
window. This causes the name(s) to appear next to the dots on the
plot. Dropping a Cluster onto the panel causes the names of all Spots
in the cluster to be displayed.</P>

<P>The "<B>AutoSpace</B>" option attempts to improve the readability
of the graphs by reducing the quantity of displayed labels. When this
mode is enabled, labels will only be drawn if there is enough space
for them. Note that when there is not a lot of space, or a lot of
labels, this mode can lead to some Spots becoming unlabelled.</P>
 
<P>Spots which have been selected for labelling can also be displayed
in colour to make them more visible. The "<B>Colour</B>" checkbox controls
this feature.</P>


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<A NAME="drill"><H3>Cluster Drill Down:</H3></A>

<P>You can 'drill down' into a Cluster by clicking on the glyph drawn
in the top-right on each graph. (This glyph is the coloured shape that
is associated with the Cluster via the <A
HREF="../../Viewer/ClusterManager/ClusterManager.html">Cluster
Manager</A>).  Profiles for the Cluster and up to eight of it's
children will be displayed. The Cluster that was drilled onto will be
in the top-left corner.</P>

<A NAME="example"><H3>Example:</H3></A>

<UL>
<P><LI>Load the tutorial file "tutorial1.maxd.gz" from the "demo"
directory (use the <A
HREF="../../Importer/ReadNative/ReadNative.html"><I>Read
Native</I></A> plugin</P>
<P><LI>Select two or more Measurements
in the top-left panel</P>
<P><LI>Select one or more Clusters in the
bottom-left panel.</P>
<P><LI>A graph will appear for for each selected
Cluster. This graph shows the expression profiles for the Spots in
that Cluster.</P>
<P><LI>Add and reomve Measurements from the selection using "Ctrl" +
left mouse clicks.
<P><LI>Add and remove Clusters from the selection using "Ctrl" +
