<P>Zipf's law (G.K. Zipf (1936) <I>The Psycho-biology of Language: An Introduction to Dynamic Philology</I>; 
G.K. Zipf (1949) <I>Human Behaviour and the Principle of Least Effort</I>) 
is concerned with the frequency of occurrence of objects, or with the 
size of objects, and how those frequencies/sizes decrease with rank r (from the highest r = 1 to the 
lowest). For example the frequency of occurrence of words within large pieces of text, or the 
sizes of cities both follow Zipf's law.</P>

<P>It has been noted recently 
(D.C. Hoyle et al, <I>Bioinformatics</I> <B>18</B> (2002), to appear) that the highest spot intensities 
from a microarray experiment (when ranked in order) follow Zipf's law very closely. This application plots 
the ordered spot intensities against rank r. When log(spot intensity) is plotted against log(rank) the 
highest spot intensities should follow a straight line. A Zipf's law exponent, represented by the Greek 
letter nu, is calculated.</P>

<P>Select a Measurement from the list on the left-hand side of the
panel. The  plot of intensity against rank is displayed
on the right-hand side.</P>

<P>The Zipf's law exponent (the <I>nu</I> value) is displayed at the
top of the graph.</P>

<P>The slider at the bottom of the panel selects how many of the top
ranking Spots will be used for the display.</P>

<P>A Log/Log scale can be selected as required.</P>
