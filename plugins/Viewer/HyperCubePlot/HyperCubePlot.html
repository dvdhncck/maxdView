<P>This plugin is an extended scatter plot for inspecting the
correlation between two or more Measurements.</P>

<P>The <I>hyper-</I>cube is a generalisation of a cube to the
<I>N</I>th dimension. The 2-cube is a flat square. The 3-cube is what
we are used to as a cube. It can be thought of as an extrusion of the
flat square into a new dimension. The 4-cube is an extrusion of a
3-cube in exactly the same way.</P>

<P>The plugin attempts to visualise hyper-cubes by projecting the
N-dimensional data into 2-dimensional space and drawing dots for each
data point. The data can be rotated about each of its primary axes
before projection.</P>

<P>When used for two Measurements, this plugin provides most of the
functionality of the <A HREF="../ScatterPlot/ScatterPlot.html">Scatter
Plot</A> plugin.</P>

<P>When used with three Measurements, it provides similar
functionality to the <A HREF="../SpacePlot/SpacePlot.html">Space
Plot</A> plugin.</P>

<P>When used with four or more Measurements the resulting
visualisations can be very disconcerting!</P>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>User Interface</H3></A>

<P><A NAME="sel"><H3><B>Selecting axes for the plot</B></H3></A></P>

<P>Select two or more Measurements from the list on the left-hand side
of the window. You can use "Ctrl+click" to add and remove individual
Measurements from the selection.</P>

<P>Each selected Measurement will be allocated to one axis of a
hyper-cube. If you choose 3 Measurements then the data space will be 3
dimensional.</P>

<P>&nbsp</P>

<P><A NAME="rot"><H3><B>Rotating and adjusting the view</B></H3></a></P>

<P>Each dimension will have a rotation knob in the top half of the
panel on the right-hand side of the window. Press and hold the left
mouse button on the edge of the knob and drag it to rotate the
data. </P>

<P>The data can also be rotated by holding the left mouse button and
moving the pointer in the image panel. Normally the mouse axes will
control the rotation in the first and second dimensions; hold the
"Ctrl" key to map the mouse axes to the third and fourth
dimensions.</P>

<P>The rotation knobs have an `auto' feature. Click in the center of
the knob to have it rotate slowly in one direction. Click it in the
center again to stop the rotation. The next click causes it to start
rotating in the opposite direction.</P>


<P>The bottom half of the right-hand panel contains three viewer
 controls:</p>

<UL>
<LI><b>Persp.</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;adjusts the degree of perspective in the projections
<LI><b>Scale</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is a global size control to fit the data to the window
<LI><b>Eye Sep.</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sets the amount of eye separation in stereoscopic views
</UL>

<P>Additional controls in the bottom panel are:</P>

<UL>
<LI><b>Show clusters</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;show cluster glyphs (for any visible clusters) in the display
<LI><b>...and edges</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;adds the edges between clusters to the display
<LI><b>Show axes</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;display the colour coded axes of the space
<LI><b>Show limits</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;display the full extent of the space
<LI><b>Apply filter</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;use the current <A HREF="../../../docs/Filters.html">filter(s)</A> to hide data
<LI><b>Use wireframe</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;use a quicker drawing method to make rotating smoother
<LI><b>Uniform scale</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;force each axis to use the same scaling factor
<LI><b>Depth sort</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;draw the data points in the correct depth order
<LI><b>Stereo</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;display the data from 2 viewpoints for low-tech stereo viewing
<LI><b>Time</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;show performance statistics
</UL>

<P>&nbsp</P>

<P><A NAME="label"><H3><B>Identifying Spots</B></H3></A></P>

<P>When the mouse pointer is rested over a dot for a moment, a
tool-tip window appears containing an identification label. This label
can be any of the <A HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#spot">Name or
Name Attributes</A> in the current data. The choice of which Name or
Name Attribute to show is made via the drop-down menu in the control
bar along the top of the window.</P>

<P>Click on a spot to add a name label to the plot. Click on the spot
again to remove the label. The "<B>Clear all</B>" button removes all name
labels that have been added to the plot.</P>

<P><A HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#drag">Drag-and-drop</A> can be
used to locate particular Spots in the plot. Drag one or more Spots
from the main display and drop them into the <I>HyperCube Plot</I>
window. This causes the name(s) to appear next to the dots on the
plot. Dropping a Cluster onto the panel causes the names of all Spots
in the cluster to be displayed.</P>
