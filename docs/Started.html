<P><H1>Tutorial: Getting started with <B>maxdView</B></H1></P>

<P>This is a quick tour of some of the main features of
<B>maxdView</B>. The internal help system is the main source of
documentation for <B>maxdView</B>. All dialogs and control panels have
a "Help" button which opens the relevant page in the help browser.</P>

<A NAME="load"><IMG SRC="images/roundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;<B>Loading data....</B></P></A>

<P>We will begin by loading a demonstration data file stored in native
format. Start the "Read Native" plugin by selecting it from the "File"
menu.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>If "Read Native" does not appear in your "File"
menu, the plugin could not be found or be started for some reason. You
need to download an extra software package to use "Load Native". See
the installation document for more details.</I></FONT></P>

<P>The "Read Native" panel is an extended file browser. Options on the
right hand side let you control how files are loaded. For this
demonstration we will ignore these controls. Unless you have
previously changed them, the default settings are fine. If you have
changed them, set them back so "Load how?" is "Replace", and all of
the boxes under "Load what?" are selected.</P>

<P>Find the "<TT>demo</TT>" directory which will be located wherever
you installed <B>maxdView</B>. In this directory will be a file called
"<TT>tutorial1.maxd.gz</TT>". This file contains some synthetic data
encoded using <B>maxdView</B> native XML format and compressed using
GZIP. Select this file and press "Open" (or double click on the
file).</P>

<P>Some data should appear in the main display, which will look
something like this: (but without the big labels!)</P>

<P><A NAME="main"><IMG SRC="images/roundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;<B>The main display....</B></P></A>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/Started1.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>This data has 19 <FONT COLOR="RED">Measurements</FONT> of 400 <FONT
COLOR="RED">Spots</FONT>.</P>

<P>Measurements (which correspond to different experiments, samples,
conditions or timepoints) are laid out left to right. The <FONT
COLOR="RED">Measurement Names</FONT> are shown along the top of the
display.

<P>The Spots are arranged down the display. Each row starts with one
or more columns of <FONT COLOR="RED">Name and Name
Attributes</FONT>. These columns will be explained <A
HREF="#attributes">later</A>.</P>

<P>The values associated with each Spot in each Measurement are
represented by the coloured boxes which take up most of the
display. Two colour schemes are in use, one for the first four
Measurements and the other for the rest of the Measurements.</P>

<P>The data also includes some <FONT COLOR="RED">Clusters</FONT>,
 represented by coloured symbols (called glyphs) linked by a
 hierarchical structure (the tree).</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="RED">Spot Clusters</FONT> appear on the right hand
 side of the display. Spots in the same Cluster can be identified as
 they have the same coloured glyph. The tree shows how the clusters
 are nested.</P>

<P>Along the top of the display, above the Measurement names, are the
<FONT COLOR="RED">Measurement Clusters</FONT>. These are shown with a
tree and coloured glyphs in the same way as for Spot Clusters.</P>

<P>We will play with the Clusters <A HREF="#clusters">later</A> in
 this tutorial.</P>

<P>As you move the mouse pointer around the display, a status line at
the bottom of the window gives information about the thing under the
pointer. This information will also appear in a <I>tooltip</I> window
next to the mouse pointer.</P>

<P>Unless you have a very big display, not all of the Spots and
Measurements will fit onscreen, so the window will have
scrollbars. Note that as you scroll around, only the Spots and
Measurements move, the Names and Clusters stay onscreen.</P>

<P>Pressing the right mouse button displays the <FONT
COLOR="RED">Popup menu</FONT>.<BR><FONT SIZE="-1">(On systems with no right button, use
<I>Ctrl + Alt + Left mouse</I> instead.)</FONT></P>

<P>The popup menu is context sensitive, in other words a different
menu is displayed for each of the different things in the display. For
example, when you right-click on a Measurement name you get a menu
specific to Measurements.</P>

<P><A NAME="popup"><IMG SRC="images/roundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;<B>Popup menu...</B></P></A>

<P>The <A HREF="Popup.html">popup menu</a> usually contains shortcuts
to functions or options available elsewhere. The menus also contain
options specific to certain elements of the display:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>The <FONT COLOR="RED">Name and Name Attributes</FONT> popup menu has
options for adding and removing the name columns, and for changing
what is displayed in the column. The concept of Names will be
explained <A HREF="#attributes">below</A>.</P>

<P>The "Sort this column" option re-orders the Spot rows so that the
values in the column are in alphabetical order. Try sorting the
different name columns.</P>

<LI><P>The <FONT COLOR="RED">Cluster</FONT> popup menu contains options
for showing and hiding parts of the cluster tree and a shortcut which
opens the <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ClusterManager/ClusterManager.html">Cluster
Manager</A>. </P>

<LI><P>The <FONT COLOR="RED">Measurement Name</FONT> popup menu includes
shortcuts to open the <A HREF="Measurements.html">Measurements</A>
control panel and  to show and hide the Measurement.</P>

<LI><P>The <FONT COLOR="RED">Spot</FONT> popup menu contains a summary of
data associated with that Spot.</P>

<P>The "Sort ascending" and "Sort descending" options order the Spot
rows based on the column that was clicked on. Try sorting the data on
different columns.</P> 

<P>As the rows are rearranged, the cluster trees become all mixed
up. This is because the Spots in each cluster are no longer
adjacent. The <A
HREF="../plugins/Transform/SortClusters/SortClusters.html">Sort
Clusters</A> plugin can re-order the Spots using the cluster
trees.</P>
</UL>

<P>All popup menus contain the <FONT COLOR="RED">Custom</FONT>
sub-menu where you can collect frequently used commands for easy
access. See the <A HREF="CustomMenu.html">Custom menu</A> help page
for more information.</P>

<P>The <FONT COLOR="RED">Selection</FONT> sub-menu also appears on all
popup menus. This sub-menu contains options for manipulating the <A
HREF="Concepts.html#sel">data selection</A>.</P>


<P><A NAME="disp"><IMG SRC="images/roundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;<B>Display
options...</B></P></A>

<P><B>1. Layout</B></P>

<P>Now we will have a brief look at how the layout and colouring of data
is controlled. Use the "Display -> Layout" menu entry to open the
layout control panel.</P>

<P>The controls in this panel are divided into four groups. The first
tab contains sliders which alter the size of the spot boxes used in
the main display. By reducing the "Column Width" and "Row Height" for
example, you can fit more data into the window.</P>

<P>Try adjusting the various layout parameters and seeing how they
affect the display. Try selecting different text fonts using the
"Text" tab.</P>
 
<P>The "Name Columns" tab of this control panel can also be used to
add and remove Name and Name Attribute columns. The "Clusters" tab
controls how Clusters are displayed. See the <A
HREF="ViewerLayout.html">help page</A> for information.</P>

<P><B>2. Colours</B></P>

<P>Use the "Display -> Colours" menu entry to open the colouriser
control panel. Colours for the data used in this tutorial are
generated by two things called `colourisers'. One, called "Raw
values", appears as a bar of smoothly varying colours from green,
through white, to red. The other, called "Error values", is
represented as three sets of type-in fields, each with a colour button
underneath them.</P>

<P>You can click on the white 'box' in the "Raw values" bar and drag
it left or right to adjust the rate at which the colurs are
blended. The data colouring in the main display changes whenever you
release the mouse button. By double clicking on the white box, you can
open a colour chooser. You can also double-click on the red and green
boxes at either end of the colour bar to change their colours.</P>

<P>You can do a lot more with colourisers, see the <A
HREF="ViewerColours.html">help page</a> for more details.

<P><A NAME="filt"><IMG SRC="images/roundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;<B>Filtering....</B></P></A>

<P>The next thing we will try is using filters to select a subset of
the spots for display.</P>

<P>Launch the "<A
HREF="../plugins/Filter/MathFilter/MathFilter.html">Math Filter</A>"
plugin using the entry on the "Filter" menu. The window that appears
is divided into four sections. In the top-left panel, you can write a
mathematical formula, such "Ex4 &gt; 0.55", which will select only
those Spots in which the value in Measurement "Ex4" is &gt; 0.55;</P>

<P>You can experiment with different formulae, such as "Ex1 &gt; Ex2
and Ex1 &lt; Ex3". The "Math Filter" understands "and" and "or" and
lets you build simple arithmetic expressions such as "(Ex1 + Ex2) * 3
&lt .0"</P>

<P>Dismiss the "Math Filter" using it's "Close" button. Closing the
window disables the filter and all Spots are shown once again.</P>

<P>Open the "<A
HREF="../plugins/Filter/ProfileFilter/ProfileFilter.html">Profile
Filter</a>" using the entry on the "Filter" menu. This filter selects
Spots based on their similarity to a chosen target Spot.</P>

<P>In the left-hand panel use the "All" button to select all
Measurements for consideration. Now pick a target spot from the list
in the right hand panel. The drop-down box above this name allows you
to search using the different names and Attributes of the Spots.</P>

<P>When a target Spot picked, the filter removes all but that spot and the 10
 most similar Spots. The main display will update to show just these
 Spots.</P>

<P>To remove the "Profile Filter", close the plugin's window.</P>


<P><A NAME="find"><IMG SRC="images/roundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;<B>Finding....</B></P></A>

<P>Use the "Display -> Find" menu entry to open the finder. This panel
has type-in fields for finding either Spots or Clusters. Type
"25/E" into the top field and select "Probe name" in the drop-down
list. Press return (or the "Go" button). The display scrolls so
that the Spot containing the Probe "25/EBO0" is at the top.</P>

<P>Press return (or "Go") again and the message "search finished, 1
found" is displayed in the finder. This tells you that there is only
one instance of "25/E" in the Probe names.</P>

<P>If you try finding "25/" instead, you will discover that each
press of return moves to another Probe with a name begining with
"25/", for example "25/OBR5", "25/JDI1" and so on.</P>

<P>You can also search for Gene and Spot names and their name Attributes,
which are introduced <A HREF="#Attributes">below</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="clusters"><IMG SRC="images/roundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;<B>Clusters...</B></P></A>

<P>Clusters are controlled using a plugin called the <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ClusterManager/ClusterManager.html">Cluster
Manager</A> which appears in the "Viewer" menu. You can also open this
panel using the "Show Properties" option in the Cluster popup
menu.</P>

<P>With this control panel you can change the colour and glyph assigned
to Clusters, make them temporarily invisible, load, save and delete
them. </P>

<P>More information about Clusters can be found in the <A
HREF="ClusterTutorial.html">Working with Clusters</A> tutorial.</P>  

<P><B>1. Hiding and Showing</B></P>

<P>Start the <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ClusterManager/ClusterManager.html">Cluster
Manager</A> plugin using the entry in the "Viewer" menu. The window
which appears is divided into three panels. The top-right panel
displays a tree in which the branches can be expanded and collapsed
using the control to the left of each Cluster name.</P>

<P>Clicking on a name in the tree panel selects the cluster. The
name colour and glyph of the selected cluster can be changed using the
controls in the top-left panel.</P>

<P>Select the Cluster called "k=1". This is a child of
"XCluster:k-means,k=5". You can select this Cluster by hand, or use
the "Cluster -> Find" menu option to find and select it.</P>

<P>Scroll the main display so that you can see the light blue Clusters
in the "k=1" part of the tree. Press the first "Hide" button in the
top-left panel. This button hides the selected Cluster and all of its
children. Note how the light blue part of the tree vanishes in the
main display. Turn the Clusters back on using the "Show" button in the
"Selection" part of the top-left panel.</P>

<P>Now hide all of the Spot clusters by pressing the second "Hide"
button in the top-left panel. Then turn on the "k=1" Clusters using
the "Show" button again. Now only the light blue Clusters are enabled
in the main display.</P>

<P><B>2. Drag and Drop</B></P>

<P>
<P>An easy way to select Clusters for editing is to use <FONT
COLOR="RED"><I>drag-and-drop</I></FONT> to bring a Cluster from the
main display to the plugin:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>Position the mouse over a glyph or tree branch in the main
display. You will know when the mouse is correctly positioned as the
status line will show the name of the Cluster.</P>
<LI><P>Press and <I>hold</I> the left mouse button.</P>
<LI><P>Move the mouse to the top-right panel of the Cluster Manager
window. The mouse cursor will be different to indicate the fact that
drag and drop is enabled.</P>
<LI><P>Release the left mouse button once the pointer in the top-right
panel. The Cluster Manager will select the Cluster and display it in
the tree.</P>
</UL>


<P><A NAME="attributes"><IMG SRC="images/roundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;<B>Names and Name Attributes...</B></P></A>

<CENTER>
<TABLE WIDTH=90%><TR><TD> <P><I>maxdView terminology </I>: Each Spot
corresponds to one well on a microarray slide. The labelled material
placed in the Spot is called the Probe. This Probe is used to detect
one or more Genes during the hybridisation process.</P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>In short: each line in the display corresponds to one Spot, which
has a unique "Spot Name". Each "Spot Name" can have an associated
"Probe Name". The "Probe Names" do not have to be unique, when
microarray data contains replicate spots the replicates should have
the same "Probe Name". Each "Probe Name" can be linked with one or
more "Gene Name". The "Gene Name" can be in any format,
<B>maxdView</B> does not support or require a particular naming
scheme.</P>

<P>Each type of name can have "Attributes". These are extra
(key,value) pairs that can be linked to each name. For example "Spot
Name" might have "Row" and "Column" attributes. Each Spot name can
then be associated with its coordinates on the array.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="NameTagEditor.html">Name Tag Editor</A> allows you to
view and edit the names and attributes for a Spot. Point at a spot in the
main display and use the right mouse button to activate the popup
menu. Select the "Edit Names &amp; Attrs" option to open the editor.</P>

<P>The name columns to the left of each line show one or more of these
Names and Name Attributes. You can control the number of columns, what
each one contains, how it is aligned and the maximum width for each
column. These controls are found in the <A
HREF="ViewerLayout.html">layout</A> control panel, acessed from the
"Display" menu.</P>

<P>The popup menu for name columns has the "Show in this column"
sub-menu. Try using this to select different Names or Name Attributes
for display.</P>

<P>You can control these columns in more detail using the <A
HREF="ViewerLayout.html">layout control panel</A>.</P>
