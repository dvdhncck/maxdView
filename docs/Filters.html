<H2>Filters</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A Filter is a rule applied to each of the <B>Spot</B>s in
turn. <B>Spot</B>s which do not obey the rule are trapped by the
filter and can be ignored by the rest of <B>maxdView</B>. This feature
is useful for reducing the complexity of analyses or visualisations by
discarding uninteresting <B>Spot</B>s. It can also be used to locate
<B>Spot</B>s which match particular criteria.</P>

<P>Using <B>Filter</B>s does not permanently remove <B>Spot</B>s, they are only hidden
whilst the <B>Filter</B> is enabled. Disabling, or altering the filter will
cause hidden Spot</B>s to reappear.</P>

<P><B>maxdView</B> allows multiple <B>Filters</B> to be active
simultaneously. They are applied in turn, in the order in which they
were created. If a <B>Spot</B> is trapped by <I>any</I> of the
<B>Filter</B>s, it will be ignored.</P>
