<P>Search for spots or clusters by name.</P>

<P> Enter all or part of a name into a search box and press "Go" (or
press return). If the name is found, the main display scrolls to
position the relevant spot at the top of the window. </P>

<P>Each subsequent press of "Go" (or return) searches for the next
occurrence of the name. A count of the number of matches is displayed
after each search. If the name is not found, the message "search
finished, not found" is shown in the Find window.</P>

<P>If the spot or cluster being searched for is not visible anywhere
(i.e. it has been hidden by a filter) then the message "found, hidden
by filter(s)" is displayed.</P>

<P><A HREF="Concepts.html#drag"><I>Drag-and-drop</I></A>&nbsp; can be used
to copy names into any of the search boxes.</P>

<P>By default, "hum" will match "human", "Human", "sub-human" etc. Use
the following controls to restrict the matching rules:</P>

<P><B>Exact Match</B> requires the search pattern to be a perfect
match, normally substring matching is used.</P>

<B>Case sensitive</B> matching means that the upper- and lower-case
version of each letter are considered to be different.</P>
