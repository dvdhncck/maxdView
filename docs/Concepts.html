<H2><A NAME="spot">Spots, Names and Name Attributes</A></H2>

<P<B>Spots</B> are <B>maxdView</B>'s basic unit of data. <B>Spot</B>s
represent all the values associated with a single cell on an
array.</P>

<P>Each <B>Spot</B> has a name and also records the name of the
<B>Probe</B> contained in that <B>Spot</B>. <B>Probe</B> refers to the
biological material placed in the cells of an array. Each <B>Probe</B>
may be linked to zero or more <B>Gene</B> names.</P>

<P>The <B>Spot</B> names must be unique within a data set as it is
these names which are used to identify a specify spot on an array. The
<B>Gene</B> and <B>Probe</B> names can be replicated to model
duplicate elements on the array.</P>

<P>All three names of name can have optional <B>Name
Attributes</B>. Attributes are text values that can be associated with
Spot, Probe and Gene names. Gene names, for example, might have
"Accession number", "Description" and "Function" attributes used to
record information about each gene. Names and their attrbiutes are
available for use in searching and other text matching operations.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="NameTagEditor.html">Name Tag Editor</A> is used manipulate
all types of name and their attributes. It is created from the popup
menu that appears over spot and name columns in the main display.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="../plugins/Transform/NameMunger/NameMunger.html">Name
Munger</A></NOBR> plugin can be used to manipulate both names and name
attributes tags in a variety of ways.</P>

<P><B>maxdView</B> does not presently specify, or support, any
particular naming convention. Names are stored and manipulated as Java
String objects, and conventional string matching rules determine
whether one name is the same as another.</P>

<P>See a picture of the <A HREF="DataModel.html">Data Model</A> for
more information about this topic.</P>

<P><HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="meas">Measurements</A></H2>

<P>A <B>Measurement</B> is collection of numbers representing values
recorded from a set of <B>Spots</B>. It corresponds closely to a single
column a numbers in a spreadsheet or traditional flat file.</P>

<P><B>Measurement</B>s have a <B>Data Type</B> which determines how
they will be coloured for display.  The <B>Data Type</B> can also be
used to group <B>Measurement</B>s together, for example applying a
command to all <B>Measurement</B> of a particular type.</P>

<P>Any number of <B>Measurement Attribute</B>s, i.e.
<NOBR><I>name-value</I></NOBR> pairs, can be associated with each
<B>Measurement</B>. This data can be accessed via the "Attributes" tab
found on the <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/MeasurementManager/MeasurementManager.html">Measurement
Manager</A> plugin.</P>

<P>Additional data values for each <B>Spot</B> can also be linked to a
<B>Measurement</B>. This sort of data, called <B>SpotAttribute</B>s
can record supplimentary information about the numerical levels, such
as confidence levels, signal intensities, and derived statistical
values. The <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/SpotAttributes/SpotAttributes.html">Spot
Attributes</a> plugin can be used to see these values.</P></P>

<P>See a picture of the <A HREF="DataModel.html">Data Model</A> for
more information about this topic.</P>

<P><HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="nans">Special numerical values</A></H2>

<P>The special value '<TT>NaN</TT>' (<I>not-a-number</I>) is used to represent
a value which is unknown or missing.</P>

<P>All comparisions in which a <TT>NaN</TT> value is tested against any non-<TT>NaN</TT> value
will be false, for example "<TT>NaN &gt; 3</TT>",  "<TT>NaN &gt;=
-2000</TT>", "<TT>400 &lt; NaN</TT>"
and "<TT>NaN &gt; NaN</TT>" are all false.</P> 

<P><TT>NaN</TT> values are equal to other <TT>NaN</TT> values, for example "<TT>NaN
&gt;= NaN</TT>", "<TT>NaN &lt;= NaN</TT>" and "<TT>NaN = NaN</TT>" are
all true.</P>

<P>The special values '<TT>Infinity</TT>' and '<TT>-Infinity</TT>' represent positive and
negative infinity respectively.</P>

<P>Infinity values behave like extreme versions of normal values, so
<TT>Infinity</TT> is greater than any other number, and
<TT>-Infinity</TT> is less than any other number.</P>

<P>Comparison of <TT>NaN</TT> values with <TT>Infinity</TT> values are always
false, for example "<TT>Infinity &lt; NaN</TT>", "<TT>NaN &gt;=
-Infinity</TT>" and "<TT>NaN = Infinity</TT>" are all false.</P>

<P>A complete description of how comparisons with <TT>NaN</TT>,
<TT>-Infinity</TT> and <TT>-Infinity</TT> values work can be found <A
HREF="DoubleCompare.html">here</A>.</P>

<P><HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="filt">Filters</A></H2>

<P>A Filter is a rule applied to each of the <B>Spot</B>s in
turn. <B>Spot</B>s which do not obey the rule are trapped by the
filter and are temporarily ignored by the rest of maxdView. This
feature is useful for reducing the complexity of analyses or
visualisations by discarding uninteresting <B>Spot</B>s. It can also
be used to locate <B>Spot</B>s which match particular criteria.</P>

<P>Using Filters does not permanently remove Spots, they are only hidden
whilst the Filter is enabled. Disabling, or altering the filter will
cause hidden Spots to reappear.</P>

<P><B>maxdView</B> allows multiple <B>Filters</b> to be active
simultaneously. They are applied in turn, in the order in which they
were created. If a <B>Spot</B> is trapped by <I>any</I> of the
<B>Filter</B>s, it will be ignored.</P>

<P>A collection of general-purpose <B>Filter</B>s is supplied with
<B>maxdView</B>. New ones can be created internally using the <A
HREF="../plugins/Transform/CodeRunner/CodeRunner.html">Code
Runner</A></NOBR>, or defined externally as <B>Plugin</b> classes.</P>

<H2><A NAME="clust">Clusters</A></H2>

<P>A Cluster is a collection of Spots or Measurements that have been
grouped together. Things might be grouped because they have similar
expression profiles, share some common annotation, or for some other
reason. The Spots or Measurements in a Cluster are termed its
<I>elements</I>.</P>

<P>In addition to elements, <B>Cluster</B>s can also contain one or
more child <B>Cluster</B>s. This allows hierarchical structures to be
contructed, to capture, for example, the output of an external
clustering program.</P>

<P>Each <B>Cluster</B> has a number of attributes associated with it; including
a name and a coloured glyph. These attributes, and the hierarchy of
<B>Cluster</B>s themselves, can be manipulated in the <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ClusterManager/ClusterManager.html">Cluster
Manager</A>.</P>

<P><B>Cluster</B>s can be defined using any of the names associated
with a <B>Spot</B>. A <B>Cluster</B> with elements defined by
<B>Spot</B> name can be re-applied to any other <B>Measurement</B>
from the same type of array. <B>Cluster</B>s with elements defined
using <B>Probe</B> or <B>Gene</B> names can be reapplied to
<B>Measurement</B>s from arrays containing any of these entities.</P>

<H2><A NAME="anno">Annotation</A></H2>

<P>Annotation refers to any text which is associated with a Probe or
Gene name. Annotation for a particular entity can be gathered from
multiple sources (i.e databases like EMBL and SwissProt) and stored
locally to reduce data loading times.</P>

<P><HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="event">Events</A></H2>

<P><B>maxdView</B> is an <I>event-driven</I> system, which means that as the
data is updated, each of the system's components are notified by being
sent an Event.</p>

<P>Different types of event are dispatched depending on how the data
has changed. This enables the various components of the system decide
whether they need to take any action in response to the change.</P>

<p>To see behind the scenes, use the <NOBR>
<A HREF="../plugins/Viewer/EventWatcher/EventWatcher.html">Event
Watcher</A></NOBR> which reports events as they occur.</p>


<P><HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="plug">Plugins</A></H2>

<P><B>Plugins</B> are Java classes which can be loaded into
<B>maxdView</B> whilst it is running. The code for the plugin classes
is not loaded until the plugin is needed, which saves space and
reduces the applications start-up time.</P>

<P>Plugins provide an easy way to extend the <B>maxdView</B> core
functionality to add extra capabilites. Plugins can have a user
interface and manipulate and display data in any way they want. Plugin
classes can also receive <B>Event</B>s, enabling then to react to changes
made by other components.</P>

<H2><A NAME="col">Colourisers</A></H2>

<P>Colourisers are objects which convert a numerical value into a
colour for display. </P>

<P>Colourisers are created and edited using the <A
HREF="ViewerColours.html">Colouriser</A> panel accessed from the
"Display" menu.  The assignment of Colourisers to Measurement is done
ia the <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/MeasurementManager/MeasurementManager.html">Measurement
Manager</A> plugin or the Measurement name <A
HREF="Popup.html#meas">popup menu</A> in the main display window.</P>

<P><HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="merge">Data Merging</A></H2>

When data is loaded (via any of the importing plugins; "<A
HREF=../plugins/Importer/ReadNative/ReadNative.html>Read Native</A>",
"<A HREF=../plugins/Importer/LoadPlainText/LoadPlainText.html>Load
Plain Text</A>", and "<A
HREF=../plugins/Importer/DatabaseLoader/DatabaseLoader.html>Database
Loader</A>") it can either replace the existing data or be merged with
it.</P>

<P>Merging is done by matching either the Spot, Probe or Gene names
associated with each spot. Names which are not recognised can be
either ignored or allocated to new Spots. More details can be found in
the <A HREF="Merging.html">Merging data</A> help page.</P>

 <P><HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="cust">Custom Menu</A></H2>

<P>The Custom Menu is accessed via the context sensitive <A
HREF="Popup.html">popup menu</A> used in the main display. Press the
<I>right</I>&nbsp; mouse button whilst pointing at a Name, Spot,
Measurement or Cluster in the display. The popup menu which appears
has a "Custom" submenu containing the option "Edit" which opens the <A
HREF="CustomMenu.html">custom menu editor</A>.</P>

<P>The editor allows to add and remove <I>command</I> enties from the
custom menu. Commands are associated with <B>plugins</B> and allow you
to access a plugin functions without launching it's user interface.</P>


<P><HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="drag">Drag and Drop</A></H2>

<P>Drag-and-drop is an easy method for moving information (such as
Spot, Measurement and Cluster names) between parts of
<B>maxdView</B>.</P>

<P>Press and hold the left mouse button to start the drag. A small
folder icon appears beside the mouse cursor. This icon can then be
'dragged' to another window and 'dropped' by releasing the mouse
button.</P>

<P>Drag-and-drop is presently supported by:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Spots, Measurements and Clusters in the main display
<LI>The "Find" dialog box
<LI>Clusters in the <I>Cluster Manager</I>'s tree
<LI>The <I>Notepad</I> plugin
<LI>The <I>Sort Clusters</I> plugin
<LI>The <I>Scatter Plot</I> plugin
<LI>The <I>RegExp Filter</I> plugin

<H2><A NAME="sel">Selection</A></H2>

<P>Data can be selected by clicking on elements in the main display
window, or programatically via the selection API. Spots, Measurements
and Clusters can be selected independantly.</P>

<P>Selected items are highlighted in the main display. Selected Spot
and Measurement names are drawn in inverted colours and selected
Clusters are drawn with a surrounding box.</P>

<P>The <A
HREF="../plugins/Filter/FilterBySelection/FilterBySelection.html">Filter
By Selection</A> plugin can be used to show or hide the selected
Spots.</P>

<P><B>Spots</B> are selected by clicking on them in the main display
window. An extended selection can be made by clicking on the start
Spot and then holding the 'Shift' key and clicking on the end
Spot. Holding the 'Ctrl' key when clicking on a Spot toggles the
selection of that Spot. </P>

<P><B>Measurements</B> are selected in the same way, i.e. by clicking
on their names. The 'Shift' and 'Ctrl' key can be used as before.</P>

<P><B>Clusters</B> are selected as follows:</P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>click</I></TD><TD>select just this Cluster</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>Shift + click</I></TD><TD>add this Cluster to the selection</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><I>Ctrl + click</I></TD><TD>toggle selection of this Cluster</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</P>

<P>Note: The 'Ctrl' key is no longer used to activate the popup menu
(for systems with a single-button mouse) instead use 'Ctrl' and 'Alt'
mouse-click to activate the popup menu.<P>

<P>The <B>Selection Menu</B> is accessed via the context sensitive <A
HREF="Popup.html">popup menu</A> used in the main display. It contains
entries which manipulate the selection. See the <A
HREF="SelectionMenu.html">Selection Menu</A> help page for
full details.</P>
