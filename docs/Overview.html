<H2><A NAME="intro">What is maxdView?</A></H2>

<P><B>maxdView</B> is a system for integrating techniques for analysis
and visualisation of expression data.</P>

<P>The design is focused on providing a comprehensive model of
expression data and a flexible, extensible architecture to allow
functionality to be added as desired, and as new techniques are
developed.</P>

<P><B>maxdView</B> provides three ways of integrating algorithms and
visualisations.
<UL>
<LI>Write Java 'plug-in' modules which are installed in the
<B>maxdView</B> menu hierarchy and have full access to the internal
data representation and underlying event model (see more information on <A
HREF="Plugins.html">plugins</A>).
<LI>Enter 'fragments' of code directly into a dialog box and compile
and execute it dynamically with a single button press. Code run in
this way has complete access to the internal data representation (see the <A
HREF="../plugins/Transform/CodeRunner/CodeRunner.html">Code Runner</A> plugin).
<LI>Interface to external programs or scripts, with two-way exchange
of both symbolic and numeric data. The data transfer can be via
standard input and output or via temporary files (see the <A
HREF="../plugins/Transform/RunExternal/RunExternal.html">Run
External</A> plugin).
</UL>

<P><B>maxdView</B> is by no means a complete analysis package, for
example it has no facilities for image processing. It is not intended
to be an all-encompassing solution. Instead, it's purpose is to
provide an infrastructure into which existing tools can be fitted, and
to assist rapid prototyping of new algorithms and visualisation
techniques.</P>

<H2><A NAME="data">What sort of data does it handle?</A></H2>

The core of the <B>maxdView</B> data model is the <B>ExprData</B>
class which represents expression data, comprising inner classes
modeling the following features:

<UL>
<LI><B>Measurements</B> represent collections of expression levels (or
other data associated with image analysis process) recorded under a
known condition.

<LI><B>Annotation</B> of each expression value records the name of the
array, spot, probe, and gene(s) associated with each numerical value,
and provides methods for retrieving textual descriptions of biological
entities from different sources. Annotation can be <A
HREF="AnnotationLoader.html">retrieved</A> from different sources then
<A HREF="AnnotationViewer.html">browsed</A> and <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/TextExplorer/TextExplorer.html">searched</A>.

<LI><B>Clusters</B> are a fairly general purpose way of handling
connections between groups of entities within a data set. <B>maxdView</B>
models clusters as a hierarchical collection of sequences of
items.</P>

</UL>

<H2><A NAME="display">What can it display?</A></H2>

<P>The main window of <B>maxdView</B> displays the conventional table
view of expression data, with the rows showing the different spots on
an array, and the columns showing the different measurement conditions
for which values are known.</P>

<P>Rows can be labelled with the name of the spot, the probe in the
spot, or the names of biological entities known to be targeted by the
probe. The table view is augmented with a dendrogram showing
relationships between rows. These relationships can be created and
modified interactively in a variety of ways.</P>

<P>Additional visualisations of the data are provided by plugin
modules, including a co-relation plots (<A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/StackPlot/StackPlot.html">Stack Plot</A>, <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ScatterPlot/ScatterPlot.html">Scatter
Plot</A>), multi-dimensional projections (<A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ProfileViewer/ProfileViewer.html">Profile
Viewer</A>, <A HREF="../plugins/Viewer/WebPlot/WebPlot.html">Web
Plot</A> and <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/HyperCubePlot/HyperCubePlot.html">HyperCube
Plot</A>) and distribution histograms (<A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/Distogram/Distogram.html">Distogram</A>).</P>

<H2><A NAME="do">What can it do?</A></H2>

<P><B>maxdView</B> provides a number of useful data transformation
operations, such as sorting, and <A HREF="Filters.html">filtering</A>
the data values in a variety of ways.</P>

<P>New transformations can be added via any of the three integration
routes outlined above. For example, if a new filtering technique is
installed as a plugin class, it will become available to all of the
other parts of <B>maxdView</B>.</P>

<P>The current version of <B>maxdView</B> provides plugins for reading
and writing  native XML and plain  text files and for  loading data to
and from <B>maxdSQL</B> databases.  Additional methods  for importing
and exporting data can be added via the plugin system. </P>
