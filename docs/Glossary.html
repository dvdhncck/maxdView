<DT>Cluster</DT>
<DD>A subset of all known data, that presumably share some attrbiute,
or are otherwise similar in some way. Clusters can be used to model
biological relationships such as families and pathways, and also
numerical relationships, such as the output of classification or
clustering algorithms. Clusters can be related to one another in a
hierarchy (actually a N-ary tree)</DD>

<DT>Code fragment</DT>
<DD>A piece of Java code which can interact with <I>maxdView</I>.</DD>

<DT>Data</DT>
<DD>Any collection of one or more Measurements is referred to as Data. </DD>

<DT>Data type</DT>
<DD><I>Measurements</I> are given a data type, one of 'Absolute Expression',
'Ratio Expression', 'Probability', 'Error' or 'Unknown'. The data type
determines which colour scheme will be used for the data, and in some
cases, how the data will be interpreted by the application.</DD>

<DT>Filter</DT>
<DD>A filter selectively disables some (or all) of the Spots in the <I>Data</I></DD>

<DT>Gene</DT>
<DD>In maxd terminology, a gene represents some biological sequence,
which might be named, and might have textual annotations associated
with it.</DD>

<DT>launched</DT>
<DD>Plugin application are launched by selecting them from the menus.</DD>

<DT>maxd</DT>
<DD><B>M</B>anchester <B>A</B>rray E<B>X</B>press <B>D</B>atabase</DD>

<DT>maxdLoad</DT>
<DD>A platform neutral interface for loading expression data (and its
related experimental data) into a <B>maxd</B> database.

<DT>maxdView</DT>
<DD>An architecuture for integrating visualisation and analysis
techniques.

<DT>maxdSQL</DT>
<DD>An implementation in SQL of the ArrayExpress database schema.

<DT>Measurement</DT>
<DD>A one group of expression levels, error or probability
measurements for a set of Spots</DD>

<DT>Plugin</DT>
<DD>A Java class which can interact with <I>maxdView</I>.</DD>

<DT>Probe</DT>
<DD>A named biological entity used to detect the presence of one or
more genes.</DD>

<DT>Spot</DT>
<DD>A single cell on a membrane, slide or array. Each Spot contains
one Probe.</DD>

<DT>XML</DT>
<DD>e<B>X</B>tensible <B>M</B>arkup <B>L</B>anguage, a platform
independant, self describing, file format used for interchange of data.</DD>
