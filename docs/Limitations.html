<UL>
<LI>
<B>Clusters</B>: <P>clusters are not re-mapped to rows when a file is
           loaded [FIXED, mostly, be careful with existing clusters
           when merging data from different array types]</P>

<LI>
<B>Code Runner</B>: <P>there is no method of killing the code fragment
if it doesn't terminate itself. [FIXED]</P>

<P>The JIT compiler interface doesn't work (yet)</P>

<P>the parsing of error messages to make the line numbeers correspond
to the code fragment doesn't work properly and make the -------^
indicators point to the wrong thing</P>
	
<LI> <B>Cluster Manager</B>: <P> the tree is completely rebuilt rather
than updated ater file operations. This is annoying because all
branches collapse. [FIXED]</P>

<LI> <B>Drag and Drop</B>: On Linux there are problems with the Custom
Menu interfering with Drag and Drop. If you use the left mouse button
to selecte something from the Custom menu, no subsequent Drag and Drop
operations will work. If you stick exclusively to the right mouse
button for the custom menu then things are ok. This is not a problem
on MS-Windows.</P>

<LI>
<B>Sort Clusters</B>: <P>the brute force algorithm (which kicks in if
the special case algorithm has failed) can take a _very_ long time to
complete (but it will complete) [FIXED, algorithm replaced with much
better one]</P>

<LI>
<B>Rescan Plugins</B>: <P>sometimes there is a very long pause after
the rescan, resizing the window makes everything work again straight
away. Not sure about this, something to do with the way the menus are
built?. [FIXED]</P>

<LI>
<B>Space Plot</B> popup menus get lost in the image canvas. It can
also use vast amounts of memory.</P>
