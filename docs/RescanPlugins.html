<H1>Rescan Plugins</H1>

<P>Search the <TT>plugins</TT> directory (and all of it's
subdirectories) looking for classes which appear to be plugins. Once
the scan it complete, a dialog box appears reporting how many plugins
have been found.</P>

<P>You only need to rescan if you have added or removed plugins from
somewhere below <TT>plugins</TT> directory. <B>maxdView</B> saves a
list of plugins which it knows about and uses this when it starts
up. </P>
