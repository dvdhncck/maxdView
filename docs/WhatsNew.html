===================================================================================


1.0.6 : 

[MathFilter]

  - fixed bug whereby the current measurement order was being ignored 

===================================================================================


1.0.5 : March 2005

[maxdView]
  - 'Print' enabled for all visualisation plugins; printing can be
    either directly to a printer to can be saving an image file in
    either PNG or JPG format.

  - 'Print' also enabled for popup graphs, e.g. those generated by
    some the normalisation plugins.

  - 'Infinity' and 'NaN' are now understood correctly in all filtering
    plugins ( and in ImportNative and ExportNative ) and a new help
    document which gives a detail explanation of how comparisons work
    has been added


QC 
  - new plugin for Quality Control which gives a statistical measure
    of the quality of experimental results, based on the method
    described in:

     "A New method for statistical control of microarray process quality", 
       Yongxiang Fang et al, 


LoadFromDatabase
 -  new plugin which allows data to be retrieved from maxdLoad2 format
    databases. This version supports loading only the data values, the
    meta-data (i.e. the attributes) are not yet handled.


ScatterPlot
  - NaN and Infinity values are automatically ignored.

  - The user interface has been tidied up, and now includes  'pan' and
    'select' mouse modes.
  

===================================================================================


1.0.4 : August 2004


[maxdView]
  - the 'config' directory is now no longer hardcoded. there are
    several ways of specifying it:

     using the optional command line arg "-config_directory"     
       which overrides
     the "user.home" system property (i.e. the $HOME environment variable)
       which overrides
     the "user.dir" system property (i.e. the current working directory)

    when the directory {$HOME}/.maxd/config does not exist, it
    will be automatically created and anything found in {$CWD/config/}
    will be copied into it - this should mean a seamless transition to
    the new set up for existing users.
    
  - plugins that are downloaded from the website will be installed
    in the user-specific plugin directories rather than in the shared
    plugin directories
 
  - fixed (yet another) problem in the dataset merging code
    which caused NameAttrs to vanish under certain circustances
 
  - numerous small bug fixes

ProfileFilter
  - 'Save Similarities' feature added


Normaliser
  - bug fixed in which the CenteringNormaliser returned incorrect
    results when the 'median centering' option was selected


[GraphPanel]
  - labels can be provided for points in both line plots and scatter plots


[DataPlot]
 -  values with infinite magnitude are now treated the same way as
    missing (i.e. NaN) values in that they are not coloured in, but instead
    drawn as empty boxes. The range calculations for the colourisers have also
    been  modified to exclude values with infinite magnitude
    

SVD
  - bug fix for a problem in which the data was not zero centered
    as expected
 

LoadPlainText, SaveAsText, WriteNative, ReadNative
  - the terms 'Infinity' and '-Infinity' are now recognised

CodeRunner
  - modified for per-user operation, each user has their own
    code-library directory (in {$HOME}/.maxd/code-library)
  
  - now uses the 'standard' class loader as opposed to having it's own one

  - interaction with java Runtime.exec() improved to remove the
    mysterious occasional compiler timeouts
  

SimpleMaths
  - bug fixed where by Measurement names that were in quotes could no
    be recognised


FilterByNameOrValue
  - handling of comparison with NaN values changed, all ordering
    comparisons are now false if either operand is a NaN :

        NaN > NaN : false
        NaN < NaN : false
        NaN > 0 : false
        NaN < 0 : false
        0 > NaN : false
        0 < NaN : false
        Infinity > NaN : false
        Infinity < NaN : false
        NaN > Infinity : false
        NaN < Infinity : false

	NaN == NaN : true


MathFilter
  - bug fixed where by Measurement names that were in quotes could no
    be recognised

  - handling of comparison with NaN values changed (as per
    FilterByNameOrValue)


MultiFilter 
  - handling of comparison with NaN values changed (as per
    FilterByNameOrValue)


Measurement Manager
  - importing of attributes has been improved; unrecognised
    Measurement names no longer cause the import to be disallowed, and
    the attribute names no longer have to line up exactly with their
    values.

WekaCluster
  - user interface improved to make the value selected by sliders
    much easier to control

  - two new methods added (Simple K-Means and Farthest First) which
    are implemented in Weka 3-4

TTest
  - a new plugin which implements Student's T-Test
    (generously contributed by Helen Hulme)

===================================================================================


1.0.3 : released March 2004

MathFilter
  - fixed serious bug which was causing the wrong Measurements
    to be tested (it was failing to use getMeasurementAtIndex())
    [this bug was introduced in version 1.0.2]

===================================================================================

  - fixed several bugs that occured when merging datasets which had no

1.0.1 : released Aug 2003

[maxdView]
  - fixed a bug which prevented merging more that two datasest from
    plain text files without renaming the spots by hand


WriteNative
  - fixed a bug whereby the data in "DisplayOrder" element did not
    take into account the fact that the "only include currently enabled Measurments"
    or "only include unfiltered Spots" change the length of the data that is
    put into the output file.


DataMunger
  - added plugin which creates new Measurements or SpotAttributes by taking
    an existing Measurement or SpotAttribute and selectively changing the 
    numerical values in Spots which are filtered (or those which are not filtered).


ReorderMeasurements
  - 'sort by name' feature added
  - 'sort by attribute' feature added


SimpleMath & MathFilter

    of tag attrs

          selected measurements so that the user interface can be
	  setup (if required by the normaliser, see "IDNormaliser" for
          an example)


Zipf

Benford
  - help docs updated
  - extra precision in display of chi-sqrd value


DatabaseLoader

    'lower_case_mode' is enabled automatically in 'workoutQuoteMode()'
    when all other options have failed.

    in version 0.8.9 it had become impossible to save files. fixed.

NameMunger

    events; in particular updates to Clusters and Measurements that
    require tree or lists to be rebuilt.
