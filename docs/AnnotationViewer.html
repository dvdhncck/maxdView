<H1>Annotation Viewer</H1>

<P>The <I>Annotation Viewer</I> displays the textual annotation
associated with a particular Probe or Gene name. The viewer is created
whenever you click on a spot or name in the main window, or when a
plugin class requests that some annotation be displayed.</P>

<P>The viewer contains one panel for each of the active sources. The
panels can be resized by dragging the horizontal bar that divides
them.</P>

<H3>User Interface</H3>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/AnnotationViewer.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>The label at the top of each panel shows the source of
that part of the annotation. Buttons at the bottom of the window (from
left to right) lock or unlock the current view, open the loading
options panel, display this help page, and close the
window.</P>

<P><B>Locking...</B></P>

<P>By default, requests for annotation cause the text to be displayed in
the current <I>Annotation Viewer</I>. If you want to compare two or
more sets of annotation, "Lock"  the current viewer by clicking on the
padlock icon in the bottom left corner. The next request for
annotation will cause a new window to be opened. You can have as many
windows as you want open. If you unlock one of the locked windows, it
will be used next time an annotation reqest is made.</P>

<P><B>Caching...</B></P>

<P>Annotation data is cached (saved in memory) when it is first loaded
to make subsequent accesses faster. The operation of the cache is
controlled in the <A HREF="AnnotationLoader.html">Annotation
Loader</A>'s options panel. </P>

<P>If you need to reload the data (if you have changed the data source
for example) use the "Reload" option on the popup menu (you can empty
the whole cache using the button in the loading options panel).</P>

<P><B>Data Sources...</B></P>

<P>Annotation from different sources is presented in the order that it
is loaded.  The data sources are selected in the <A
HREF="AnnotationLoader.html">Annotation Loader</A>'s options
panel.</P>
