<A NAME="overview"><H2>Overview</H2></A>

<P>Annotation refers to any text which is associated with a Probe or Gene
name. Annotation for a particular entity can be gathered from multiple
sources (i.e databases like EMBL and SwissProt) and stored locally to
reduce data loading times.</P>

<P>Annotation is displayed in the <A
HREF="AnnotationViewer.html">Annotation Viewer</A> which is activated
when you select "Display Annotation" in the main window's <A
HREF="Popup.html">popup</A> menu. The viewer also allows you to access
the annotation loading options.</P>

<P><B>maxdView</B> caches the annotation data as it is first loaded,
this makes subsequent accesses faster. If you need to reload the data
(because you have changed the data source for example) you have to
empty the cache manually using the button in the loading options panel
(see <A HREF="#caching">below</A>).</P>

<A NAME="sources"><H2>Sources</H2></A>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="images/AnnotationLoader-sources.jpg"><BR>The sources tab
in the loader options panel</P></CENTER>

<P>You can change the order in which the sources are searched using
the up and down arrows to the right of each source. The delete button
(immediately to the right of the source name) permanently removes the
source. To temporarily disable a source, uncheck the "Active" checkbox
below the source's name.</P>

<P>Three type of data source are currently supported; Script, URL and
File. Any number and mixture of these source types can be used to
retrieve annotation for a given spot.</P>

<P>Each source is has the following controls:
<UL>
<LI><B>Name</B>: how the source will be titled displayed in the Annotation Viewer
<LI><B>Active</B>: whether the source should be used 
<LI><B>Type</B>: sources can be 'Script', 'URL' or 'File' (see below)
<LI><B>Location</B> where to find the script, URL or directory for this source
<LI><B>Parameters</B>: the arguments to be passed to the source
</UL></P>

<P>The 'name' line is unimportant in the data gathering purpose - it
is only used to refer the source. The use of the <B>Location</B> and
<B>Parameters</B> controls depends on the type of the source and is
explained in the sections below.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><HR ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=25%></P>

<P><B>Script</B> sources are programs which can be invoked to generate
annotation</P>

<TABLE WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD><FONT COLOR="#222222" SIZE="-1">

<P>The full path and name of the script should be specified in the
sources <B>Location</B> control, for example
"<TT>/home/people/dave/bin/srs-wrap.pl</TT>".</P>

<A NAME="vars"><P>Parameters are passed to the script using <B>variables</B> which refer to
the names or name attributes of the spot. All variable names begin
with a '$' (dollar) character and are enclosed in curly braces
'{}'. For example, the probe name associated with a spot is called
"<TT>${Probe.Name}</TT>". Any attribute that a name has can be used as
a variable, for example "<TT>${Gene.ACC_NO}</TT>" and
"<TT>${Spot.ROW}</TT>". </P></A>

<P>Any text in the argument list that is not recognised as a variable
name is passed directly to the script. At least one variable must
appear in the <B>Parameters</B> control for the source to be
considered valid. Names that appear to be variable names but which
cannot be matched with real attribute names will cause an error
message to be displayed.</P>

<P><I>Example:</I> Calling the <TT>wgetz</TT> utility (from the <A
HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/srs/">SRS</A> package)</P>

<P>In the  source's <B>Location</B> control specify
the full path and name of the
script:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>/home/SRS/bin/wgetz</TT>.</P>

<P>In the source's <B>Parameters</B> control specify the command-line
arguments to pass to the script:<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>-e
"[embl-all:${Gene.Name} acc:desc]"</TT></P>

<P>When the a request is made to the source, the <TT>${Gene.Name}</TT>
part of the argument list will be replaced with the actual gene name
and the script will be invoked. If, for example, the gene is called
'Y1234' then the following command will be executed:</P>

<NOBR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;/home/SRS/bin/wgetz -e "[embl-all:Y1234 acc:desc]"</TT></NOBR>

<P>Any text that the command produces (on either it's standard or
error output streams) will be captured.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><HR ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=25%></P>

<P><B>URL</B> sources represent a web servers which generate
annotation in response to CGI requests.</P>

<P>Note: The HTTP POST method is used to send the parameters. This
will not work with URL handling scripts that use the GET method.</P>

<TABLE WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD><FONT COLOR="#222222" SIZE="-1">

<P>CGI is the mechanism used to handle the forms commonly found on
web sites. A request is sent to the URL named in the source's
<B>Location</B> field along with the data in the <B>Parameter</B>
control.</P>

<P>Variables are used in exactly the same way as with script sources,
see <A HREF="#vars">above</A> for details.</P>

<P>The <B>Parameter</B>s must be in the correct <I>URL encoded</I>
form. The encoding is the same as that used for specifying CGI
parameters within a URL, for example:</P>

<NOBR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.demo.org/cgi-bin/demo.pl?arg1=val1&arg2=val2</TT></NOBR>

<P>An easy way to discover which parameters to use and how to encode
them is to use a web browser to access the annotation source
'manually'. The URL location displayed in the browser will show you
how the <B>Parameters</B> should be defined.</P>

<P>You do not need to specify the '?' character that separates the
URL's location from it's parameters.  For example, to access the above
URL the source's <B>Location</B> would be:</P>

<NOBR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.demo.org/cgi-bin/demo.pl</TT></NOBR>

<P>and the parameters would be</P>

<NOBR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;search=all&id=${Probe.Name}</TT></NOBR>

<P>Aside: Using a proxy server:</P>
<P>If your internet connection requires the use of a <B>Proxy
Server</B> you must inform the Java environment when you start
<B>maxdView</B>. The following command-line parameters are used:

<P><PRE>
   java -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxyhost

<UL>
<LI>Each parameter should be separated by an ampersand ('&') character

<P><B>File</B> sources are directories on a local filestore that
contain annotation text.</P>

<TABLE WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD><FONT COLOR="#222222" SIZE="-1">

<P>Annotation is looked for in the directory specified in the source's
<B>Location</B>. The file name will be generated using the source's
<B>Parameters</B> value. </P>

<P>If the path separator ('/' on Unix, '\' in MS-Windows) or a
non-alphahumeric character occurs in a value specified for the file
name, it is replaced with an underscore ('_') before the file is
searched for.</P>

<P><I>Example:</I> Assume you have created files with names based on
the position of a spot on it's array. Information about the spot at
row X and column Y is stored in a file called "<TT>spot_X_Y.dat</TT>".
A source to load this information would have it's <B>Parameter</B> set
to:</P>

<NOBR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;spot_${Spot.ROW}_${Spot.COL}.dat</TT></NOBR>

<P>(this assume that you have created Spot name attributes called "ROW"
and "COL" and populated them with values).</P>

<P>Note: having tens of thousands of files in the same directory is
likely to make your file system very unhappy.</P>

<A NAME="caching"><H2>Caching</H2></A>

<P>As data is loaded by a source it will be cached in memory. Next
time the source is requested to load the same annotation, the data
will be retrieved from the cache rather than it's real location.</P>

<P>Data is cached on a per-source basis, that is, each source stores
it's data separately. If you change either the source's
<B>Location</B> or <B>Parameters</B>, data cached for the old location
or parameters will be ignored and the new data will be cached. </P>

<P>The entire cache can be written to and read from a file. This
allows you to retrieve annotation one time only and save it between
runs of <B>maxdVIew</B>.</P>

<P>The cache is controlled by a tab in the loader options panel, open
this panel using the "Options" button in the <I>Annotation Viewer</I>.</P>

<P>The controls are:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Empty</B> the cache of all data
<LI><B>Save</B> the cache to a file
<LI><B>Load</B> the cache from a file
</UL>

<P>A panel also displays some statistics about the amount of data
currently in the cache. The "Hit Rate" shows how effective the cache
is being.</P>

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="autoloading"><H2>Autoloading</H2></A>

<P>The autoload feature attempts to load the annotation for all spots
using threads running in the background. You can use this to retrieve
annotation for a large number of spots as a one-off process and then
save the cache (see <A HREF="#caching">above</A>) for later use.</P>

<P>Autoload generates a load requests for all of the spots and the
background threads consume these load requests one at a time. The
status label informs you how many load requests are currently pending
and how many threads are currently active.</P>
