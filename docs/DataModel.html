<P>The links between elements show how they are connected, the
decorations on the links show many of each element can be linked.</P>

<P>For example, a "SpotName" can be linked to 0 or more
"SpotNameAttribute"s but a "SpotName" must be linked to exactly one
"Spot". Similarly, every "Spot" much have a "SpotName" but can have
zero or more "GeneName"s.</P>

<P>(note that "SpotAttribute" should really be called
"SpotMeasurementAttribute" but it isn't...)<P>
