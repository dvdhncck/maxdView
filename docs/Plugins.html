<A NAME="about"><H2>About plugins</H2></A>

<P>Plugins provide an easy way to extend <B>maxdView</B> to add extra
capabilites. Plugins can have a user interface and manipulate and
display data in any way they want using the <B>maxdView</B> core as a
support environment.</P>

<P>The Java code for the plugins is not loaded until the plugin is
<I>launched</I> by the user. This speeds up the loading of the main
application, and reduces the memory footprint as functions which are
not used never take up any space.</P>

<P>Plugins are kept in a directory called <TT>plugins/</TT>, which is
futher subdivided into directories for the main types of plugin. When
<I>scanning</I> for plugins, the application will search any class
files and directories in the file system starting at the "plugins/"
directory.</P>

<P>You can find out more about the plugins that are currently known to
the system on the "<A HREF="About.html">About</A>" help page.</P>

<P>Plugins can provide commands which allow you to access them from
within your own code. You can write simple scripts which use these
commands with the <A
HREF="../plugins/Transform/CodeRunner/CodeRunner.html">Code Runner</A>
plugin. A complete list of all plugin commands is <A
HREF="PluginCommands.html">available</A>.</P>

<P>Plugins that are downloaded from the <b>maxd</b>website, or created
'locally' by a user will be installed in the
<I>per-user</I> plugin hierarchy, which means they will only be
available to the user who installed them. The <I>per-user</I> plugin
hierarchy is seperate from the <I>shared</I> plugin hierarchy, which
contains the set of 'standard' plugins that are shipped with
<b>maxdView</b>. If a plugin in the <I>per-user</I> hierarchy has
the same name as one in the <I>shared</I> hierarchy, then it will be
used preferentially.</P>

<A NAME="manager"><H2>The Plugin Manager</H2></A>

<P>The <A HREF="PluginManager.html">Plugin Manager</A> is activated
using the entry on the <B>System</B> menu.</P>

<P>The Plugin Manager can automatically download new plugins (and
updated versions of existing plugins) from the <B>maxdView</B> web
site. It can also be used to un-install plugins that are not required
and to change the order in which plugins are listed in the main
menu.</P>

<P>In addition, the Plugin Manager provides the "Rescan Plugins"
feature which is used to 'manually' register new plugins with the
system.</P>
