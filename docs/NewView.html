<H2>Display: New View</H2>

<P>Creates a new instance of the main viewer window displaying the
same data as the current viewer. Both views are displaying the same
data, if you change it in some way, both views will reflect this
change.</P>

<P>The main reason for having two (or more) views open is that each
view can be positioned at a different place, and also that each view
can independantly choose whether to apply the filter.</P>
