<P>This document describes the different parts of <B>maxdView</B> that
allow you to create and visualise clusters.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<A NAME="groups"><P><IMG SRC="images/smallroundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;<B>Using
Clusters to group things together</B></P></A>

<P>Clusters are useful for storing groups of Spots, Probes Genes and
Measurements.</P>

<P>If you have used a filter to select an interesting set
of Spots, creating a Cluster will allow you to quickly identify those
Spots at a later time.</P>

<P>For a practical example, we will use the the demonstration data
file "<TT>tutorial1.maxd</TT>". See the <A HREF="Started.html">Getting
started</A> tutorial for details on where to find this file.</P>

<P>Once you have loaded "<TT>tutorial1.maxd</TT>", use a filter a
isloate some of the Spots. For example use <A
HREF="../plugins/Filter/FilterByNameOrValue/FilterByNameOrValue.html"><I>Filter
by Name or Value</I></A> to select spots with "enzyme" in their Gene
names.</P>

<P>Start the <A HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ClusterManager/ClusterManager.html"><I>Cluster
Manager</I></a> plugin. Selecting the "Create" option on the "Cluster"
menu displays the following dialog box:</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="images/CreateCluster.jpg"></P></CENTER>

<P>Select the second option, "...from filtered Spots", then provide a
name for the new Cluster. The newly created Cluster will have all of
the Spots which pass through the filter as its elements.</P>

<P>You will be able to see this new Cluster in the <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ClusterManager/ClusterManager.html"><I>Cluster
Manager</I></a>s tree viewer. The new Cluster is allocated a random
colour and glyph. The controls in the <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ClusterManager/ClusterManager.html"><I>Cluster
Manager</I></a> allow you to change these properties. </P>

<P>After you disable the filter (by closing its window) the new
Cluster `remembers' which Spots were selected by the filter. If you use a
plugin which can display Clusters, for example the <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ScatterPlot/ScatterPlot.html"><I>Scatter
Plot</I></a>, you will be able to see the Cluster glyphs identifying
the previously filtered Spots.</P>

<P>Repeat the Cluster creating process using a different filter then
use a <I>viewer</I> plugin to compare the two Clusters.</P>

<P>The <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ClusterManager/ClusterManager.html"><I>Cluster
Manager</I></a> provides several other ways of creating Clusters, such
as loading names from a file or by combining existing clusters.</P>

<A NAME="files"><P><IMG SRC="images/smallroundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;<B>Generating files for the Cluster Manager to load</B></P></A>

<P>One method for loading Cluster data into <B>maxdView</B> is to
generate files that the <A
HREF="../plugins/Viewer/ClusterManager/ClusterManager.html"><I>Cluster Manager</I></A>
can read.</P>

<P>The simplest format 'List of Names' allows you to specify a single
cluster in a file. Each line of the file should contain exactly one
name, for example:</P>

<PRE>
YBR042c
YBR108
YBL012a
YBL012b
YLC0981
</PRE>

<P>You can specify any name or name attribute to match with. If one or
more of the elements in the file match existing data then a cluster
will be created. Names that are not recognised are ignored.</P>

<P>The 'Native' file format allows you to create a hierarchy of
clusters from a file. The format is human-readable and uses XML
syntax. See the <A HREF="FileFormats.html#cluster">File Formats</a>
for more details.</P>
