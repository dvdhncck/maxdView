<H2>Overview of Annotation Handling</H2>

<P>Annotation refers to any text which is associated with a Probe or Gene
name. Annotation for a particular entity can be gathered from multiple
sources (i.e databases like EMBL and SwissProt) and stored locally to
reduce data loading times.</P>

<P>maxdView displays annotation in the <A
HREF="AnnotationViewer.html">Annotation Viewer</A> . The viewer is
activated by selecting "Display annotation" from the popup menu over a
Spot in the main display. The viewer displays annotation from one or
more sources in a series of panels.</P>

<P>Annotation data is cached as it is first loaded, this makes
subsequent accesses faster. The cache can be controlled via the <A
HREF="AnnotationLoader.html">Annotation Loader</A> options panel. This
panel is opened using the "Options" button in the viewer.</P>
