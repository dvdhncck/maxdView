<P><A NAME="top"><H1>Tutorial: Working with Plugin Commands</H1></A></P>

<P>The <TT>loadPlugin()</TT> and <TT>runCommand()</TT> methods
provided by the <TT>maxdView</TT> class allow you to invoke plugin
commands from within your own code. This both facilitates writing
macros and enables intra-plugin communication.</P>

<P>This document describes how 'macro' functions can be built by
glueing together existing commands.</P>

<P>Several larger examples are provided in the
"<TT>code-fragments</TT>" subdirectory:</P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="../code-fragments/load-edit-save-example.java">load-edit-save-example.java</A></TT><BR> 
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;script-demo.java</TT><BR> 
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;name-munger-demo.java</TT><BR>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;super-grouper-demo.java</TT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P> <H2><IMG SRC="images/roundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;Using <TT>runCommand()</TT>....</H2>

<P>Any plugin command can be accessed by calling the
<TT>runCommand()</TT> method of a <TT>maxdView</TT> object:

<PRE>
  void runCommand( String plugin_name, String command_name,  String[] args)
</PRE>

<P>The first two parameters give the name of the plugin (as it appears
in the menus) and the name of the command. The third parameter is an
array of strings in which the arguments for the command are
specified. Arguments are listed as <I>(name, value)</I> pairs of
strings within the array, for example:</P>

<PRE>
  String[] args = new String[] 
  {
    "file",            "example.dat",
    "start_line",      "1",
    "end_line",        "1024",
    "comment_prefix",  "#"
  };
</PRE>

<P>All argument values are specified as strings irrespective of their
real type. For instance, the integer value 7 is represented as "7" and
the boolean value true is represented as "true".</P>

<P><B>Example:</B> To call the <A HREF="../plugins/Transform/SortByNameOrValue/SortByNameOrValue.html"><I>Sort by Name or Value</I></A> plugin and
sort the Spots based on Spot name:

<PRE>
  String[] args = new String[] 
  {
    "name",      "Spot name",
    "order",     "descending"
  };

  mview.runCommand( "Sort by Name or Value", "sort", args );
</PRE>


<P><H2><IMG SRC="images/roundarrow.jpg">&nbsp;<B>Running more than one command....</B></H2></P>

<P>Many plugin commands such as "<TT>sort</TT>" are 'one-shot' in the
sense that when they are called the plugin is started, does its job
and then goes away. Other commands are 'persistant' in that the plugin
remains running after the command has finished. An example is the
"<TT>start</TT>" command supported by most filter plugins. When a
filter plugin is started, it remains alive until it is sent a
"<TT>stop</TT>" command or the user closes it's window.</P>

<P>To be able to send more than one command to the same instance of a
plugin, a handle to the plugin object is required. This is obtained
using the <TT>loadPlugin()</TT> method which returns a <TT>Plugin</TT>
object. This object can then be used in calls to
<TT>runCommand()</TT>.</P>

<P><B>Example:</B> To start a filter, use it to define a new Spot
selection and then remove it:

<PRE>
  <FONT COLOR="BLUE">// first clear the current selection</FONT>
  edata.clearSpotSelection();

  <FONT COLOR="BLUE">// load the filter plugin and save the reference to it</FONT>
  Plugin my_filter = mview.loadPlugin( "Math Filter" );

  <FONT COLOR="BLUE">// build an arguments array for the filtering rule</FONT>
  String[] args = new String[] { "filter", "Time1 > Time0 and Time2 > Time1" };

  <FONT COLOR="BLUE">// start the filter plugin with the specified filtering rule</FONT>
  mview.runCommand( my_filter, "start", args );

  <FONT COLOR="BLUE">// add filtered Spots to the current selection</FONT> 
  edata.addFilteredSpots();

  <FONT COLOR="BLUE">// and then stop the filter plugin</FONT> 
  mview.runCommand( my_filter, "stop" );
</PRE>
