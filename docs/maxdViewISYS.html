<H1>maxdView ISYS Integration</H1>

<P>This document describes how <B>maxdView</B> can run as a client of
the NCGR's <A HREF="http://www.ncgr.org/isys/">ISYS</A> integration
system (see <A
HREF="http://www.ncgr.org/isys/">http://www.ncgr.org/isys/</a> for
full details of ISYS).</P>


<P>Data tranfer is based on collections of one or more
Spots. <B>maxdView</B> can send any combination of <A
HREF="Concepts.html#spot">Names and Name Attributes</A> to other ISYS
components.</P>

<P>If some data has been sent from <B>maxdView</B> to other ISYS
viewer services then <B>maxdView</B> is said to be synchronised with
the components providing those services. When viewers are
synchronised, ISYS keeps the data selection the same in each. Altering
the <A HREF="Concepts.html#sel">selection</A> in one component will
have a corresponding effect in all other synchronised components.</p>

<P>The ISYS "hide and show" facility is integrated with
<B>maxdView</B> via the <A HREF="Concepts.html#filt">filter</A>
mechanism. If one or more filters are enabled in <B>maxdView</B>, hide
and show events will be sent to other ISYS components sharing the same
data.  Similarly, when Spots are hidden by an ISYS component, a
corresponding filter is installed in <B>maxdView</B>. See <A
HREF="#filter">below</A> for more details.</P>

<A NAME="package"><H2>Packaging data to send to ISYS</H2></A>

<P>ISYS is a centralised broker that enables communication between
two or more individual components (such as <B>maxdView</B>).</P>

<P>ISYS provides a feature called Dynamic Discovery. This allows
clients (in this case <B>maxdView</B>) to find out about
<I>services</I> offered by other ISYS components.</P>

<P>Two types of service are supported; <I>viewer services</I> which
provide a visualisation capability and <I>data services</I> which
perform data manipulation. <B>maxdView</B> can send Spots to either
type of service (and optionally capture the output from data services,
see <A HREF="#capture">below</A>).</P>

<P>Communication to ISYS is via the current <A
HREF="Concepts.html#sel">Spot selection</A>. The ISYS Dynamic
Discovery mechanism is invoked whenever the the selection is
changed.</P>

<P>Each available service will be represented in the "Send to" submenu
on the <A HREF="Popup.html#select">Selection</A> popup menu.</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/maxdViewISYSSendTo.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P><A NAME="packmap"><H3>Defining the "Data Packer" mapping</H3></A></P>

<P>Before <B>maxdView</B> can talk to ISYS, a common terminology must
be agreed on. The <B>maxdView</B> Spot data must be converted into the
format supported by ISYS. You must specify how ISYS should interpret
each of <B>maxdView</B>'s <A HREF="Concepts.html#spot">Names and Name
Attributes</A>. This is done using the "Data Packer"
dialog box:</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/maxdViewISYSPackager.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>The dialog box contains entries for all of the Names and Name
Attributes in the current <B>maxdView</B> data. The
"Include" check box on the left of each line controls whether the Name or Name
Attribute will be included in the data sent to ISYS.</P>

<P>Each of the Names or Name Attributes can be linked to one ISYS
Attribute. More than one Name or Name Attribute can be linked to the
same ISYS Attribute.</P>

<P>The mapping specified in this dialog remains in force after the
dialog box is closed. The dialog will not be redisplayed unless Name
Attributes are added or removed from the <B>maxdView</B> data. If this
has happened, then the dialog box will be redisplayed before any more
data is sent to ISYS.</P>

<P>For best results, always include the <B>maxdView</B> <TT>Spot
Name</TT>s. As they are guaranteed to be unique, they are ideal for
subsequent <A HREF="#match">matching</A>.</P>

<H3>ISYS Object model</H3>


<P>When sending data, <B>maxdView</B> generates one ISYS Object for
each Spot. The Name and Name Attributes specified as included in the
mapping are stored as ISYS Attributes within the ISYS Object.</P>

<P>&nbsp</P>

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="match"><H2>Receiving and matching data from ISYS</H2></A>


<P>When <B>maxdView</B> receives data from ISYS, a <I>mapping</I> is
needed to specify how the ISYS Attributes are converted into
<B>maxdView</B>'s <A HREF="Concepts.html#spot">Names and Name
Attributes</A>. This mapping is normally the inverse of the mapping
used to convert from <B>maxdView</B> to ISYS (see <A HREF="#packmap">above</A>).</P>

<P>Each time a new ISYS Attribute is encountered, the "Data Matcher"
dialog box will be displayed:</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/maxdViewISYSMatcher.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>Each of the possible ISYS Attributes can be matched with one of the
<A HREF="Concepts.html#spot">Names and Name Attributes</A> in the
current <B>maxdView</B> data.</P>

<P>Use the dropdown menus to select which Name or Name Attribute to
compare each ISYS Attribute with. The "Ignore" option can be used to
cause <B>maxdView</B> to disregard certain ISYS Attributes that are
not of interest.</P>

<P>When <B>maxdView</B> receives one or more ISYS Objects, it uses the
mapping to determine how the ISYS Attributes in the received data are
related to the Names and Name Attributes in the data it already
has.</P>

<P>Given a suitable mapping, the incoming data can be matched with
Spots in the existing data. The values of the ISYS Attributes can be
compared with values in the <B>maxdView</B> Names and Attributes to
determine which ISYS Objects correspond with which Spots.</P>

<P>Use the checkboxes on the right of each line to select which ISYS
Attribute to use for matching. You may select more than one attribute
as candidates for matching. When more than one match option exists,
<B>maxdView</B> will choose the first one in the list that is present
in the data that it receives. </P>

<P>For best results, use <TT>Spot Name</TT>s for matching as they are
guaranteed to be always be present and unique.</P>

<H3>Example One</H3>

<P>The following example shows how some ISYS format data (in the table on the
left) can be matched with the same data in <B>maxdView</B>.</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/maxdViewISYSExample2.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>Using the "Data Matcher" dialog, the ISYS Attribute "ORFName" has
been mapped to <B>maxdView</B>'s "Gene Name(s)" and selected to use
for matching.</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/maxdViewISYSExampleMatch2.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>Three of the four ISYS objects can be matched with Spots by
comparing "ORFName" with "Gene Name(s)". These matches are shown by
the blue lines.</P>

<P>Note that one object (<TT>YRD444</TT>) matches with two Spots in
the <B>maxdView</B> data. Matches of the form "one-to-many" are handled
automatically.</P>


<H3>Example Two</H3>

<P>In this second example, the ISYS Attribute "GeneSymbol" has been
mapped to a <B>maxdView</B> Name Attribute called "Symbol". This
mapping has then been selected for use in matching.</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/maxdViewISYSExampleMatch1.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>The follow picture shows the reduced level of matching that is
achieved:</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/maxdViewISYSExample1.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>Two of the four ISYS objects can be matched with Spots by comparing
"GeneSymbol" with "Symbol". The <TT>YRD444</TT> object (which
previously matched two <B>maxdView</B> Spots) is ignored because it
has no "GeneSymbol".</P>

<P>&nbsp</P>

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="showhide"><H2>Show and Hide</H2></A>

<H3>Sending show/hide events</H3>

<P>When one or more <B>maxdView</B> <A
HREF="Concepts.html#filt">filter</A>s are enabled, ISYS "show" and
"hide" events are sent to any synchronised components. These events
will cause the components to hide ISYS Objects corresponding to
filtered Spots.</P>

<P>The mapping specified in the "Data Packer" dialog (see <A
HREF="#packmap">above</A>) is for converting <B>maxdView</B> Spots
into ISYS Objects.</P>

<H3>Receiving show/hide events</H3>

<P>When <B>maxdView</B> notices that a synchronised component has
"hidden" one or more objects, it uses the <A
HREF="#match">matching</A> process to convert the objects to Spots,
and then installs a <A HREF="Concepts.html#filt">filter</A> which
hides those Spots.</P>

<P>The 'ISYS' filter is identical to other <B>maxdView</B> filters
except tht it has no user interface. The filter is controlled
automatically in response to ISYS "hide" and "show" events. When there
are no hidden objects the filter is removed. The "<A
HREF="Commands.html#filt">Filter</A>" menu in the main display will
indicate the percentage of data that is currently hidden.</P>


<P><B>Note:</B> Sending and receiving of show and hide events can be
disabled using the <A HREF="#opts">ISYS Options</A> panel.</P>
 
<P>&nbsp</P>

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="capture"><H2>Data Capture</H2></A>

<P><B>maxdView</B> can 'capture' data that is received from ISYS data
services.</P>

<P>Normally the result of calling an ISYS data service is sent to
another ISYS component. When <I>capture mode</I> is enabled  the values of the
ISYS Attributes can be stored in <B>maxdView</B> <A
HREF="Concepts.html#spot">Names and Name Attributes</A>.</P>

<P>This feature enables useful information provided by ISYS
components (such as the "ORF to Gene Converter") to be added to
existing <B>maxdView</B> data.</P>

<P>Capture mode is enabled using the "Allow capture" checkbox in the
<A HREF="#opts"><NOBR>ISYS Options Panel</NOBR></a>. In capture mode,
a variant of the "Data Matcher" dialog is displayed when data is
received from an ISYS data service:</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/maxdViewISYSGrabber.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<P>This "Capture Data" dialog has the same mapping controls as the
"Data Matcher" dialog (see <A HREF="#match">above</A>). 

<P>The "Capture" button at the bottom of the dialog starts the capture
process. Once the ISYS Objects have been matched with <B>maxdView</B>
Spots, each ISYS Attribute that is not mapped to "Ignore" is examined
for 'new' values. 'New' refers to values not present in the
<B>maxdView</B> Name or Name Attribute that the ISYS Attribute has
been mapped to. Any new or different values in the ISYS data are
stored in the <B>maxdView</B> data.</P>


<P>The "Capture Data" dialog also contains a dropdown menu with a list
of possible ISYS services. Beside the menu is a "Send" button. You
can use these controls to send the data directly back to ISYS without
capturing any of it.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> Capture mode is disabled by default because it is
possible to set up mappings that cause data to become "scambled". Not
all ISYS components use the same "one spot per object" model as
<B>maxdView</B>. Capturing data from components such as "ORF to Gene
Converter" works correctly, but you are advised to use this feature
on other components with care.</P>

<p>&nbsp</P>

<P><HR></P>

<A NAME="opts"><H2>The ISYS Options Panel</H2></A>

<P>The options panel is accessed using the "ISYS Options" entry on the
<A HREF="Popup.html">popup</A> menu in the main display.</P>

<P><I>(This entry is only available when <B>maxdView</B> is
running as an ISYS client.)</I></P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/maxdViewISYSOptions.jpg"></CENTER></P>

<UL>
<P><LI><B>Packing</B></P>

<P>The "Edit mapping" button opens the "Data Packer" mapping dialog
box.</P>

<P>By default, ISYS objects are cached were possible. If you are
running short of memory, caching can be disabled using the "Enable
caching" checkbox.</P>

<P><LI><B>Matching</B></P>

<P>The "Edit mapping" button opens the "Data Matcher" mapping dialog
box.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="#capture">Capture mode</A> can be enabled
using the "Allow capture" checkbox.</P>

<P><LI><B>Show/Hide</B></P>

<P>The sending and receiving of "show" and "hide" events can be
independantly controlled by these two checkboxes.</P>

<P><LI><B>Selection</B></P>

<P>The "Scroll display" option makes the main display scroll to show
each new Spot as they are selected.</P>
