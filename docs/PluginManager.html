<P>Much of the functionality of <B>maxdView</B> is provided by
'plugin' modules that are loaded into the system as required. The
<i>Plugin Manager</i> provides a number of useful administrative
features:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Automatically download and <A HREF="#checkweb">install new plugins</A> (from the <B>maxdView</B> web site)<BR>
<LI>Discover and <A HREF="#checkweb">install updated versions</A> of existing plugins<BR>
<LI><A HREF="#hide">Remove plugins</A> that are no longer required<BR>
<LI><A HREF="#scan">Register plugins</A> which have been installed by hand<BR>
<LI><A HREF="#menus">Change the order</A> in which plugins are listed in menus<BR>
</UL>

<P>The <i>Plugin Manager</i> has two display modes: a table listing
the name, type and version of plugins and a tree representing the
organisation of plugins in the main menu hierarchy. A tabbed panel is
used to switch between the two different views.</P>

<P><TABLE WIDTH=100% BGCOLOR="#555555" CELLPADDING=1><TR><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE><A NAME="install"><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#eeeeee">&nbsp;Installing and Removing Plugins</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="#overview"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../images/docprev.gif"></A><A HREF="#checkweb"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../images/docnext.gif"></A></TD></TR></TABLE></P>

<P>The 'Plugin' tabbed panel contains a table which has one row per
plugin. The name, type and version of each plugin is displayed. Each
row also contains a checkbox which controls whether the plugin is
enabled. Plugins which are not enabled are not displayed in the main
menus or on-line documentation.</P>

<UL>
<LI>The '<B>name</B>' of the plugin is the name that will appear in
the relevant menu entry and in the index for the on-line
documentation. Each plugin must have a unique name, and the name of a
plugin cannot be changed by the user.<BR>

<LI>The '<B>type</B>' determines which of the top-level menus the
plugin will be listed in. There are 5 possible types: importer,
exporter, transform, filter and viewer. The type of a plugin is fixed
by it's author and cannot be changed. Is it however possible to <A
HREF="#menus">change the order</A> in which plugins are listed in each
menu.<BR>

<LI>The '<B>version</B>' number identifies a particular release of a
plugin. For example version "1.5.0" is newer than version "1.4.1"
which in turn is newer than version "1.4.0".<BR>
</UL>

<P>Clicking on any of the column headings sorts the table based on
that column, for example in alphetical order of name.</P>

<P>Changes made in this table (i.e. disabling or enabling plugins) are
not activated until the "<B>Apply</B>" button is pressed. If it is
attempted to close the <i>Plugin Manager</i> before the changes have
been applied, then a warning message will be displayed with the option to apply
or discard the changes.</P>


<P><TABLE WIDTH=100% BGCOLOR="#cccccc" CELLPADDING=1><TR><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE><A NAME="checkweb"><B>Automatic update</B></A></TD><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="#install"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../images/subdocprev.gif"></A><A HREF="#hide"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../images/subdocnext.gif"></A></TD></TR></TABLE></P>

<P>The "<B>Check for updates</B>" button starts the automatic updating
process (note that this button is only visible when the tabbed panel
containing plugin information table is selected). A connection to the
internet must be available for this process to work, if the
<B>maxdView</B> website cannot be located then an error message will
be displayed.</P>

<P>Once <B>maxdView</B> has retrieved information from the website a
dialog box will be displayed which will list any plugins that are
newer than the versions currently installed. Select one or more
plugins from this list and press the "<B>Install</B>" button to begin
downloading the plugins. Once the download is finished, the plugins
will be registered automatically and will be available for use.</P>

<P>Plugins that are downloaded from the website will be installed in
the <I>per-user</I> plugin hierarchy, which means they will only be
available to the user who installed them. The <I>per-user</I> plugin
hierarchy is seperate from the <I>shared</I> plugin hierarchy, which
contains the set of 'standard' plugins that are shipped with
<b>maxdView</b>. If a plugin in the <I>per-user</I> hierarchy has
the same name as one in the <I>shared</I> hierarchy, then it will be
used preferentially.</P>

<P>Some updated plugins might rely on features only available in the
latest version of <B>maxdView</B>. If that is the case then these
plugins will be identifed and it will not be possible to select them
for installation. The latest version of <B>maxdView</B> can be
installed using the automatic setup program; see the <B>maxdView</B>
website for full details.</P>



<P><TABLE WIDTH=100% BGCOLOR="#cccccc" CELLPADDING=1><TR><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE><A NAME="hide"><B>Removing unwanted plugins</B></A></TD><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="#checkweb"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../images/subdocprev.gif"></A><A HREF="#scan"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../images/subdocnext.gif"></A></TD></TR></TABLE></P>

<P>Plugins can be removed from the system by un-ticking the relevant
checkbox in the information table visile in the "Plugins" tabbed
panel. Once the change is confimed by pressing the "<B>Apply</B>"
button, the entry for the plugin will be removed from the main menu
and from the on-line documentation. There will still be an entry for
the plugin in the information table should it be desired to re-enable
it at a later date.</P>

<P>When a plugin is disabled,the program code (and associated files)
for the plugin is not actually deleted from the <TT>plugins/</TT>
directory (this makes it easier to re-enable the plugin later). To
permanently remove a plugin, the subdirectory in which it resides can
be deleted by hand.</P>


<P><TABLE WIDTH=100% BGCOLOR="#cccccc" CELLPADDING=1><TR><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE><A NAME="scan"><B>Scanning the plugin directory</B></A></TD><TD VALIGN=MIDDLE ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="#hide"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../images/subdocprev.gif"></A><A HREF="#menus"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../images/subdocnext.gif"></A></TD></TR></TABLE></P>

<P>The "<B>Scan plugin directory</B>" button causes <B>maxdView</B> to
examine all of the files in the <TT>plugins/</TT> directory (and
subdirectories) looking for Java class files which appear to be
plugins. This feature is typically only used when a new plugin has
been added 'by hand', i.e. not by the automatic updating system.</P>

<P>The "Menu" tabbed panel contains a representation of the main menu
structure as a tree. Each menu is displayed as a branch of the
tree. Branches can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the small
symbol to left of their names.</P>

<P>Entries can be dragged up and down within each menu. Entries cannot
be dragged betwen menus, for example the "<I>Read Native</I>" plugin
must always be in the "Import" menu.</P>

<P>Changes made in the tree are not commited until the "<B>Apply</B>"
button is pressed. If it is attempted to close the <i>Plugin
Manager</i> before the changes have been applied, then a warning
message will be displayed with the option to apply or discard the
changes.</P>

<P>The "<B>Reset</B>" button returns the menu arrangement to the
built-in default setting. Any user applied changes will be removed.</P>
