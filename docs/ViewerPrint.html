<P>Prints some or all of the spots as seen in the main display.</P>

<P>The current <A HREF="ViewerLayout.html">layout</A> settings
(i.e. Row Height, Column Gap, etc) are used when printing. The only
difference between the screen version and the printed version of data
will be due to differences between size of the window and page.</P>
 
<P><B>NOTE:</B> printing is not currently fully implemented. Some
features do not work properly yet.</P>

<A NAME="interface"><H3>User Interface</H3></A>

<P><B>Print format</B> selects the destination for the print job:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>The <B>Printer</B> option will cause a platform dependant printer
selection dialog box to appear to enable you to select a printer and
the set page size etc. </P>

<LI><P>The <B>Image file</B> options save the data as either an ASCII or
binary <TT>.ppm</TT> image. The binary version of the format produces
considerably more compact files than the corresponding ASCII
version. The <TT>ppm</TT> format is used because it is very easy to
generate. Although the format is not supported by many applications,
it can be converted to something more portable using any decent
'paint' program.</P>

<P><B>Print what</B> selects which Spots will be included: </P>

<UL>
<LI><P><B>All spots</B> selects all of the data elements</P>

<LI><P><B>All spots, apply filter</B> selects all of the data elements
that pass the current <A HREF="Filters.html">filter(s)</A>.</P>

<LI><P><B>Currently visible spots</B> <I>doesn't work properly!</I></P>
</UL>


<P><B>Print how</B> controls some printer specific options: </P>

<UL>
<LI><P><B>Single Page</B> fits all of the data onto a single page</P>
<LI><P><B>Multiple Pages</B> uses as many pages as neccesary to draw
the data</P>
<LI><P><B>White background</B> overrides the selected background colour </P>
<LI><P><B>Black test</B> overrides the selected text colour</P>
