   current SQL operations for getting a Measurement:

      SELECT Spot.ID, Probe.Name,Expression_Level, Output_Description_ID
        FROM SpotMeasurement, Spot, Probe
       WHERE Measurement_ID = xxx AND 
	     SpotMeasurement.Spot_ID = Spot.ID AND 
	     Spot.Probe_ID = Probe.ID

   taking ~40s per Measurement (for 4439 spots) using current implementation
   
   ( including having an index on SpotMeasurement(Measurement, Spot) )

   

   1. Idea: 

    make the JOIN smaller by doing the Spot->Probe matching separately
    from the Spot->SpotMeasurment matching

      SELECT Spot.ID, Probe.Name
        FROM Spot, Probe
       WHERE Spot.Probe_ID = Probe.ID
         AND Spot.Array_Type_ID = xxx

    then

      SELECT Spot.ID, Expression_Level, Output_Description_ID
        FROM SpotMeasurement, Spot
       WHERE Measurement_ID = xxx  
	 AND SpotMeasurement.Spot_ID = Spot.ID

    This would also mean that the Spot->Probe info would only have to
    be loaded once when multiple arrays of the type are loaded


    Loading with the JOINs split into 2 parts actually tkaes about the
    same amount of time as loading with the one big JOIN. However,
    there is an advantage in loading the probes once only. Loading the
    probes takes about 1/4 of time (given the current ration between
    the cartesian products <Spot*Probe> and <SpotMeasurement*Spot>.
