<P>The <I>Database Loader</I>  plugin can import data from a <A
HREF="http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/microarray/maxd/maxdSQL/"><B>maxdSQL</B></A>
database using a JDBC connection.</P>

<P>When this plugin is started, the <A
HREF="../../../docs/DatabaseConnection.html">Database Connection</A>
panel will be displayed. Use this panel to login to a maxdSQL
database.</P>

<P>Once you have logged in, a new panel appears. This panel is
initially empty</P>

<P><B>1. Choose browse table</B></P>

<P>Use the "<B>Browse by</B>" dropdown menu to select which database
table is used to generate the list of Measurements. You can choose
between Array, ArrayType, Experiment, Extract, Hybridisation ,and
Image.</P>

<P>The "<B>and show</B>" dropdown menu will be updated to contain all
of the entries from the table selected in "<B>Browse by</B>".</P>

<P>Use the "<B>and show</B>" menu to pick one instance. The
Measurement list in the top-left panel will now display all
Measurements which are linked to this instance.</P>

<P><B>2. Select Measurement(s)</B></P>

<P>In the top-left panel, a list of Measurement names will be
displayed. The contents of the list depend on the <B>Browse by</B> and
<B>and show</B> selections. Changing either of these selections
results in a new list being shown.</P>

<P>Select a single Measurement by clicking on it. Select a continuous
range by clicking on the first Measurement in the sequence and
'Shift-Click'ing on the last one. Use 'Ctrl-Click's to toggle the
selection of a single Measurement.</P>

<P><B>3. View details</B></P>

<P>The top-right  panel displays the details of the database
relationships of the currently selected Measurements. Details include
the names of the samples, extracts, protocols used to generate this
data. This data will be loaded as <A
HREF="../../../docs/Measurements.html#attributes">Measurement
attributes</A>.</P>

<P><B>4. Select Spot Attributes</B></P>

<P>By default, any <A HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#spot">Spot
Attributes</A> that Measurements have will not be loaded.</P>

<P>In the bottom-left panel are checkboxes for the Spot Attributes of
the selected Measurements. Each Spot Attribute can be independantly
selected for loading.</P>

<P>When more than one Measurement is selected, checkboxes for all spot
attributes found in any selected Measurements are shown. If a spot
attribute is not present in all selected Measurements, then the number
of Measurements that do have it is shown beside the name.</P>

<P><B>5. Select Gene, Probe and Spot details</B></P>

<P>Additional data may exist in the database for each of the Spot,
Probe and Gene names. This information can be loaded into
<B>maxdView</B> as <A HREF="../../../docs/Concepts.html#spot">Name
Attributes</A>.</P>

<P>Controls in the bottom-right panel determine whether these details
are loaded for each of the name types.</P>

<P><B>6. Load the data</B></P>

<P>Once you have selected all of the Measurements (and additional data)
you are interested in, use <B>Merge</B> to add them to the existing
data, or <B>Replace</B> to remove the existing data prior to
loading. See the <A HREF="../../../docs/Merging.html">Merging data</A>
help page more details on how merging is performed.</P>
