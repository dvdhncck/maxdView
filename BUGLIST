===========================================================================================


[   ]   'too many gene names' when exporting plain text for data with
        multiple genes per probe
  

[   ]   divide by zero problem in SimpleMaths
        (cannot replicate bug report from florent_cripeau)

[   ]   AnnotationViewer:

            url=  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/LocRpt.cgi
	    args= l=4893   {Gene name}

	    some HTML is loaded, but nothing is displayed


[ F ]   "Measurement Ordering is wrong length" when exporting a subset of
        Measurements using "Write Native"


[ F ]   plugin library doesn't work - plugins are in the wrong directory?
        (acutally, the directory didn't exist!)


[ F ]   Progress window does not shut when merging data is completed


[   ]   "Filter By Name Or Value" doesn't work using the Cogeme_Chemostat
        data set


[   ]   "Show Attrs" and "Show Props" in the DataPlot popup for Measurment
	both open the Measurement Manager
	

[   ]   Measurement clusters exported from ClusterManager not importable
	(reported by Paul Edlefsen)


[   ]   JAR file not unloaded after use in DatabaseLoader
	(will be fixed when CustomClassLoader is upgraded)


[   ]   DatabaseConnection displays no feedback during  connection on low
	bandwidth connection


[   ]   DatabaseConnection is not used in all places that it should be
	(i.e. AnnotationLoader)


[ P ]   When replacing data, the user should be queried as to whether they
	want the existing clusters to be removed. If not, cluster->spot
	mappings to need to be rechecked more carefully


[ F ]   sql.ResultSet and sql.Statement need to be closed() properly as
	per lastest maxdLoad version


[   ]   DatabaseLoader should be multithreaded and be able to be interrupted


[ F ]   All filters need load/save function as per MultiFilter


[ F ]   All filters should have a history list and history editor to make
	it easy to store common filters and reapply previously stored filters


[ S ]   Scatter Plot & Hypercube Plot should support log axis scaling


[   ]   ScatterPlot becomes confused when the existing data is replaced
	(i.e. when Measurements that are currently being plotted no longer exist)


[ F ]   Math Filter's "scale to fit" is broken


[ F ]   Math Filter should have auto-counting like the other filters


[ S ]   CodeRunner library entries should not be included in distribution JAR file


[   ]   The ConnectionManager for DatabaseLoader has no 'help' function


[   ]   The ConnectionManager for DatabaseLoader should not be modal


[   ]   The Method list in CodeRunner should (optionally) be alphabetical and
	(ideally) should have a one line comment for each method


[ S ]   Compilation should be threaded in the CodeRunner, with some feedback


[ S ]   unknown bug in CodeRunner: see "code-fragments/cannot-be-compiled.java"
        (possibly in parsing the compiler output, or generating the popup window?)
	(report: java.lang.InternalError: getGraphics implemented only for Canvas Components)
 
        furthermode: seems to be something to do with either the UserInputCancelled
	exception or the getMEasurementChoice user input method

	compilation of code examples with these functions is odd, either compiled
	and then no output, or compilation never terminates

	believed to be caused by interactions between different versions of the
	compiler; if maxdView is compiled with 1.3, and the CodeRunner is
	using 1.2.2, then it will stall under certain conditions

	a time-out has been added that will kill the compiler after a fixed
	amount of time has passed without it completed.
	

[   ]   Several examples in code-fragments need documenting and/or updating


[   ]   some viewer plugins (StackPlot, AppInABox, EventWatcher, ...) should be 
	optional and not included by default (this requires the addition of
	a 'PluginManager')


[   ]   NotePad plugin causes NPE when opened with null ExprData


[   ]   SpotAttr names not properly detected in LoadPlainText ?


[   ]   SpotAttribute viewer should show the current spot selection and should
	permit sorting on any of the spot attrs


[   ]   SortByNameOrValue should permit sorting on any of the spot attrs


[   ]   WriteNative should add a .maxd suffix to filenames if not provided by the user


[ F ]   ReadNative doesn't handle 'Infinity' as a value


[   ]   WriteNative includes things such as ArrayType, SpotSelection when they are empty,
	needs to be more selective


[   ]   ScatterPlot should close the "Pick Meas" window if it is open when the plugin
	is shut down by the user


[   ]   LoadPlainText displays the "data in column X has illegal entries" repeatedly,
	once per column, rather than accumulating all the errors together.


[ F ]   MultiFilter panel should include a scrollpane (and maybe a scale slider?)


[   ]   TextExplorer tokenising is too slow


[   ]   CodeRunner sometimes displays a totally unrelated message after a successful
        "update" operation


[ F ]   Measurement properties should give some stats about the Measurement(S)
	eg min, max, #nans


[   ]   class Measurement should have getMinValue and getMaxValue methods


[ F ]   Table cells in the Measurement attribute editor should not be editable


[   ]   The progress-o-meter should be temporarily hidden when requesing user
	input during a data merge. The p-o-m does not disspear correctly at the
        end of the merge too....

 
[ F ]   when a progress-o-meter is killed by hand, something odd happens to the
	focus on XP (i.e. it keeps shifting out of the current window, perhaps
	the JTimer is still running?)


[ F ]   The getChoice() input methods need a scrollpane when there are a lot of
	options


[   ]   When clusters are renamed in the ClusterManager, the tree view is not
	updated to show the new name


[   ]   The ClusterManager.ColourSetChooser is not compiled by default
	update: it _is_ compiled, but sometimes the class is not found on its first use 


[ P ]   [from D.Hoyle] Filtering. If I created filtered data sets using
        a)  Filter by name or value,  b)Math filter,  (but in each case using the
        same mathematical expression) I got different results when using the
        distrogram plugin.
	update: probably caused by the Measurement indexing bug in MathFilter (see below)


[   ]   [from D.Hoyle] I did a PCA analysis of a data set and then
        plotted the projections onto the 1st and 2nd principle
        components using Scatter plot. However there appeared to be a
        spurious point plotted whose coordinate corresponded to the max
        and min intensity values observed within the raw data set.


[ F ]	[re: rmiDemo, from P. Edelfsen] 
	
	The line (ExprData.java:6776) was:
		    rsl = 
	(RemoteSelectionListener)external_selection_listeners.elementAt(r);
	It needs to be:
		    rsl = 
	(RemoteSelectionListener)remote_selection_listeners.elementAt(r);


[   ]   ScatterPlot 'spot/measurement picker' windows can be easily duplicated 
        and/or orphaned: need to keep track of them


[ P ]   The custom column ordering in SaveAsText is lost whenever the table
	is rebuilt (but it should be retained where possible)


[   ]   The eigen-genes and eigen-arrays plots in SVR are redundant. Instead
	the GraphPanel should be used to display the EigenValues (scree-plot) 


[ F ]  The MathFilter was using the wrong Measurements under certain conditions
	(confusion between getMeasurement and getMeasurementAtIndex)


[   ]  Multiple Spot labels inthe Spot Attribute viewer should be given multiple
	columns in the table


[ F ]  bool-ops in the MultiFilter are not drawn in the right place when the
	window is resized (too wide)


[ P ]  MultiFilter doesn't notice when new SpotAttributes are added to 
	(should update the list in the rule editor)
	-> all rule editors are removed whenever a measurement update event
	   is recieved.

[   ]  FilterByNameOrValue user interface gets out of hand with large numbers
       of measurements. 
       options: 1. remove this filter altogether (functionality available elsewhere)
	         2. add splitpane and limit size of lower panel
	         3. ability to add/remove the individual rules on demand


[   ]   LoadPlainText's AutoPArse function doesn't guess the data start and end lines
	correctly


[ F ]   SaveAsText column headers do not correspond with column contents when
	a column is empty, for example when Gene name(s) are requested in the 
	output, but none are present.

	cause: ExprData.getFullNameTagArray() does not work as advertised.
	fixed in 0.9.5/b3


[   ]   'browse' in RunExternal does not work


[   ]   Normalise plugin (the different methods) needs more documentation


[   ]   SVD plugin needs more documentation


[   ]   Read Native needs updated documentation for new options


[   ]   Save As Text documentation is very out-of-date


[   ]   Save To Database plugin needs more documentation


[   ]   Code Runner needs updated documentation for new options


[   ]   Super Grouper plugin needs more documentation


[   ]   Scatter Plot  plugin needs more documentation (about the Axes and Decorations features)


[   ]   Distrogram  plugin documentation is very out-of-date


[   ]   Spot Attributes plugin needs updated documentation for new options


[   ]   Compare Clusters plugin needs more documentation


[   ]   HyperCube Plot plugin documentation is very out-of-date


[   ]   PRogrammer's Guide is missing several advertised sections


[   ]   from: mitzi@genomes.rockefeller.edu

         there's bug such that if I open the normalise window,
	 then do nothing and try and close it again,
	 the program throws and error, and I get a pop-up window
	 saying so.  when I click on "OK", the error message window
	 goes away.  the normalize window is still open, however,
	 so I click to close and get the pop-up window again,
	 ad infinitum.
	 
	 here's what the error log looks like:
	 
	 java.lang.NullPointerException
	 at GGMNormaliser.saveProperties(GGMNormaliser.java:28)
	 at Normalise.cleanUp(Normalise.java:22)

[   ]   from: norm
	 Simple Maths Plugin:
	   This proved popular except when just pointing and clicking....
	   i.e. "Column1" -"Column2"
	   Didn't  work because there wasn't a space between the minus operator and
	   the next column header. Silly I know but it was baffling and annoying
	   for some users.


[   ]   SpacePlot layout of bottom button panel takes up too much V
        space for no good reason
